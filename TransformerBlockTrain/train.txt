I know a lot of people like to travel and knock a couple spots up the bucket list
I'm curious for you, what made you feel excited about Airbnb?
Total available credit is like 45,000 and I got about 14,000 used or,
That's all looking for is just the way, the path, the road
So at some point the money is really just a tool to get things that we want
This is something you can ease into
Yeah, a lot more. Especially in the locations where I'd wanna be in too
Cause I have some buddies that have done that too, and stuff like that
I'll go ahead and email that
I can tell you if you've sought this out already, it sounds like you've some time to this
I should check some of this stuff out really quick. And this is gonna be a rough estimate. How much are you paying mortgage on that?
But we gotta find a way to get to, to the goal while also doing something dope
I can also, what I'll also do for you, if it's easy I'll send over a calendar invite to your email address
In a perfect world, what ideal income were you hoping to get to?
Brown will give you a call tomorrow, 1:00 PM Mountain Time
If you got to 2000 a month, you wouldn't stop there, would you?
Rogers, just make sure anyone I place on his calendar like this, watches that important pre-call video beforehand, just takes about 30 minutes
I don't have a problem with at all
Yeah, for sure. And are you familiar with rental arbitrage or Airbnb arbitrage that strategy?
17, okay, gotcha. And then is that net or gross?
So my bills were higher as well
Now obviously if that's the case, well then that does require a higher level of investment
So he is booked out until Wednesday
I was just talking to a guy who started with his, Jerry, he's from California
Could I share something with you, which I think if you made this tweak, you could really freaking kill it with Airbnbs
Would you want me to do that?
In order to protect our executive consultant's time, especially Mr
Cuz you're newer to the whole Airbnb business but not to real estate
Could you watch that before your call?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Got a lot of pools out there. It's nice. Sky's still expensive too.
When should I, So that get started now we're
So I was asking you cuz the second thing to look at when you're going to get leases is your annual income
A hundred K a month by the time I'm 27 or 28 without, and a hundred k a month without commission from electrical wholesaling
We close, my closing is <inaudible> but we make money
Yeah, I would pick the brains at a couple questions that I have. That'd be fine.
But I worked with the guy who did and he asked me to give you a call
Okay. Yeah, I'd be willing to talk to him.
We don't have the connections, we don't have the support
No, it's rent and the rent is 1450.
Yeah, I mean as long as the boat's not sinking, I think we be able to accomplish that
Hours. Okay. But maybe two to three hours per week.
Really? Yeah, it set me behind and that was so painful, but I learned my lesson
<affirmative>. Yeah, for sure. And why five to 10 specifically?
Well means I wouldn't be relying upon trading my time for money at that point unless I wanted to just jump on storm work.
Because ultimately that's what we're after
But essentially that's where you can actually go out and pitch landlords and property owners on the idea of renting their place to you
Whether you haven't even started the course or maybe you have temper opportunities already
But I was at a seven 15
And the average property with arbitrage is netting about 2000 a month
And then down the line, six months, you're at $6,000 a month and then $12,000 a month in 12 months
When you have a job, it's a lot of things you wanna do, you can't do
If you can find some vitamin details, just swallow, please, please do it
I don't have a problem with that
Wow. And would you bring the kids with you guys as well to Europe?
Yeah, I just said it was
I was actually right reaching out to another owner, which is funny.
Yeah, I appreciate it. Will I hear from you again or?
And I'll also probably send you a few texts to confirm that's good for you guys early next week
I don't have to have money for my kids
Okay. Yeah, that would be great. And where are you at now?
So I'm basically gonna say none for cash on hand just based on keeping my current safety net
I'd wanna memorize and raise good children, I guess. Yeah.
So much going on between then and now and still
I want to help people serve people
How about 3:00 PM on Monday?
I kind of wanna just build a portfolio that way
I guess go ahead and schedule me at 11 for Tuesday and I'll move some things around
So you were like, man, people are making some crazy money of this
So I am super excited to see how your conversation goes, Manny
I think so, yes. It should be the one I'll
Gotcha. Where does that drive come from you think?
We don't go really just ballpark. If it's six 10, like 6 20, 6 30, it's like a ballpark
So are you familiar with the rental arbitrage model?
He's got the context that he needs to figure out maybe what kind of leases you might be able to get
You might as well. If you can just send one over. I know I have it in there somewhere. I would
My first year I sold 25 houses
Brian Paige is trying to increase our average results of anyone that's actually bought something from us
Is that the best email for you?
Sounds good. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
Well what we found actually is a lot of folks are getting started on this top of a full-time job
So I'm gonna manually put you on the calendar here just cuz we're having a little bit with the calendar software
So I'm curious, what got you excited about Airbnb in the first place?
You're like man, this could actually be my ticket to financial freedom
But I've gotten blessed in many ways just by being me and helping people
We got the book here, see if there's any way that we could actually help out
Six months to a year possibly.
And Kamala, I hope you have an awesome rest of your day
So storage unit has very low hours that I would need to put in
Would 11:00 AM or 1:00 PM work for you?
So our consultant, Miss Funk, has the context that she needs to guide you in the right direction in terms of leases and whatnot
And to think about just walking away from that seems awfully irresponsible
At what time did you just say fourth? I don't do much
So I'll definitely be available if they call me
Hey Sophia, this is Cooper with BNB Formula and Brian Page's team. How you doing?
I don't know, all of a sudden I'm just having some doubt about the whole thing with that
And also send over a confirmation email for you as well
How many property again? I do a half. I can half the 10,000. Can you mention that one more time?
So for you man, was there anything in particular that got you kind of interested in Airbnb in the first place?
If you recall, you got his book a few weeks ago on how to create financial independence with Airbnbs
I don't, and that's where my focus is at right now
So is there any reason why you wouldn't be able to make it?
We can definitely get that going
That ring a bell for you
So the more success, the more I guess we can expand or whatnot, <affirmative>
That's my primary work phone and my name is Cooper
I control my schedule and when I work
I don't think I didn't know it
So what are you guys thinking there?
12 is good on Monday. Great.
I have a internet service coming out to the house today, home alarm system getting put in
It may not be, but just basically be ready at 11 o'clock right around that time
I'm gonna show her how to do it
I want to do totally avenue half dope chibo hunt, that's a marijuana theme, sub shop with a bar
I believe at a six 50.
<affirmative>. So for you after expenses and your bills and stuff before the car, what's like priority number one?
And I think I may have a super solid idea of how we can help you
And what time do you get off work today?
Well that should be just about everything then for Mr
So that's just an hour or maybe not an hour, but just consultation time to talk to me
I mean right now I'm like, I'm pretty good with where I stand
Okay. Wow. Yeah, that that'd be great.
I'm getting, I like it's on Saturday, so kind of caught guard
The reason I'm calling you is I'm actually the manager of our student success team here for Brian
It would just be executive consultation.
Good morning. This is Dr. Fume from Lifted. Can I help you?
Hey Steven, it's Thomas with b and b Formula from Brian Page's team. How you doing?
Cruise people saying, Hey, at <inaudible> Delta whatever, fuck family crime, whatever it's gonna be
And then in my mind I'm like, yeah, it feels weird cuz it feels like my home
I mean, I don't have anything, never
I can't work very long or do very much when he's here
I gotta do I great opportunity <affirmative> with the job in Dallas
And we also have a ton of people who work remote all across the country
All right. And then a card number?
Time cancel or reschedule booking ID number that
And then after that we just go out in the field and do all this stuff
Brian Page has kind of giving me the green light to do whatever I can to help people out
You know what I'm saying? Once I have the determination and the simple facts of this is what I'm doing, it's on
So either leave a message or send me a text message if I don't answer
It just looks better, reflects better for the company
Time. Stay positive if you can. You're gonna have the call in less than 24 hours.
Well that's the context plus the stuff you gave me
Yeah, lemme see what time I'm flying back
I mean the latest HC business that I bought bought the building along with it
Plus it's awesome to see people having success at Airbnbs
And he is phenomenal at what he does
Jackson's consulting process is just to make sure that he's helping everyone that needs help in your business
But I know you're good for at one
So just wanna make sure everyone's time is being valued and respected
But I mean obviously if that's the case, that would require a higher level of investment
Well this sky is the limit once you get into it
Well, dude, it was good getting to know you today
Your, You can keep your ring jacket any time just for friend
Cuz I really just enjoy hearing how our students, the breakthroughs they have on these calls, it's just wonderful to hear about those
Beautiful. All right, Tyler, great getting to know you. I'll lock everything in here, get you set up and shoot everything your way via email.
Oh, they all have 10,000 available there. There's no balance.
I wouldn't really wanna tap into anything else
Yeah, exactly. So know. But that only happens if you're super successful with it. And so that's kind of like the game plan here,
Sounds good. Thank you. I appreciate it.
Oh yeah, yeah. 10 being the highest, right?
Just wanted to triple check just cause we do have a policy to charge a hundred dollars cancellation or reschedule fee for these appointments
Now I can do a three o'clock or a five 30 in the afternoon
Should be coming through any minute now.
So essentially my question is, if you were 10 times smarter than the rest of the world, how much would you wanna make?
So that is really my biggest obstacle
There's no pull involved in it.
I'm getting old so I wanna sit back and relax
And then the only last thing before the call is let's see here, I'm gonna put you with Mr
No, no, no. Oh, I thought that you are talking about motivation wise. How motivated are you to get to
Few years I've been dragged through the mud <laugh> and then Covid of course kinda dragged everybody through the mud together.
It would just be vital in helping you and your brother squeeze some more profit outta your business or scale in that way
Be able to follow your passion like that, David
So financially wise I'm definitely probably a two or a three maybe
As a part of our consulting process, we wanna make sure that we're helping anyone that would need to be helped in your business
It's just a phone call, just something we're offering some people to get them a little bit farther down the line
The course is all over the internet
Great. So obviously the first thing to look at when you get a lease is your credit score. So what's your credit score right now?
Yeah, I mean I work quite a bit, self-employed, my own company, I run it
Other people advertise it to, I'm not expecting to be a millionaire
William Butler you'll be speaking with, and then send over a calendar invite to you as well on that
So consultant has the context that they need just to help figure what kinda lease you get
Cool. Let's do tomorrow. Do you want to do 10:00 AM
Cause we have used our business name and I forgot it was the group part at the end, so that is abbreviated
Yeah, so he gonna gimme a call or what?
I've been doing it for a couple years already, so it's just nice you know, miss birthdays and holidays and stuff like that.
That's kind of that business owner mentality, putting your money to work
Let's see, Are you central time?
Then their goals really at the end of the day to serve as a skip button for you
I think this is something that will really help you out and now we don't have to do it
I'd say that's about what I have saved up for a deposit.
And how does Wednesday look for you? Does a 1:00 PM sound good for you?
We do have some mornings open on Wednesday. We have a 10 11, we have a 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM open on Wednesday.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry not to cut you off. Do you have Airbnbs already?
Just wanted to triple check, just cuz we do have a policy to charge a hundred dollars cancellation or reschedule fee for these appointments
Okay, I'll give you a call back.
We've seen people with a lot worse
Okay, gotcha. Why travel? Has that always been something you guys wanted to do?
Normally everybody I work with is Torrance, my family call me Tory
Let me see what I can do here
Okay. So you said you're an Eastern time zone. Oh is that her? Yeah,
You said three bedroom, two and a half bath,
Having another stream of income to get I guess have a little bit more would be nice to kind of invest
So that should be just about all the context he needs for you guys and your husband as well
Do you know your credit score offhand, Mike?
Would 9:00 AM or 1:00 PM work better for you?
One that locked in for you. Okay. So Friday at 10:00 AM
That's kind of the catch, right? You show people how to do Airbnbs, but without buying the property
Could you commit to watching that before your call?
No, I just checked the car
Just says invitation my name BNV Formula executive consultant at Wednesday <affirmative> December 8th.
And it seems like you're kind of skeptical
So you know, helping me provide me that with that right now
I wanna be able to have the choice to be like, yeah, if you want to get it, if not, don't worry about it
I just locked to my calendar
<affirmative>, but you gotta get to a certain level before you can do that. Right.
So for you, in a perfect world, they didn't have any boundaries
So when I've been looking at, I'm just thinking on the ballpark
More money. So that's like your biggest obstacle right now preventing you from having success with Airbnbs is the capital, the money
How long does the call typically take? Cooper?
Cool brother, sounds good. Let me pull up the calendar here. Why don't you tell me what time zone you're in?
You can a hundred percent make that you're good to go for that
Typically it is a thousand dollars time slot
Okay. Do you have a name for it?
They're just putting in about two hours a week towards this to acquire their first property and they're getting one every 45 days
That's a few questions just to get some background information
Well that should be all the information in context that Mr
And I appreciate you. I appreciate you for everything.
The reason I'm calling you is I'm actually just the manager of our student success team for Brian
I mean is that something you'd want to do?
I don't know if you remember or not, but you got Brian's book a while back
10 k I would say that's not enough
And I only have your first name in the system here for some reason
Typically it's a thousand dollars slot
Well, the ideal would be 25,000 a month.
So just so that we're fully aware, who else would be involved in your Airbnb business? Maybe a spouse or a partner?
That's the beautiful part about it
We'd be looking at the next couple days, we could squeeze something in there
Through it, excited and didn't even do nothing with, I mean my wife got so
Right now? I would say it's a little, I don't have, Do I have to give you an exact
So this number that you called me on is the number I text.
I could do it. I could make the decisions. <affirmative>. It might be helpful if she gets involved or maybe not. I don't know.
Well the reason I'm calling and I don't worry, I'm not here to sell you anything
I've watched enough videos on YouTube about it to have analysis paralysis out of my system
These people put the wrong information down
It would probably be around, So here's the issue
What was it that kind of made you feel excited about Airbnb in the first place?
But more European countries and cities
I like the text message and calling me back
I've heard good things about the real estate market in Arizona.
Right. Let's do the 4:00 PM
And then the bottles of wine and the mints and everything's those big things that he talked about
At that point you kind have a almost unlimited free time
That might be a little too early.
So do you mind helping me fill out a few questions for him really quick?
Yep, absolutely. Have a good day.
Yes. I should be here too. I think maybe we'll get started cooking our Thanksgiving dinner, but,
No, what were you gonna say?
Cool. Sounds good. And then which time zone are you in
And each of those, I have different paths
And I'd honestly, I'd hate for you guys to ever have to pay that
So anyway, what was your name please? Sure
Or I used to, my answer used to be around traveling cause I used to travel internationally for enjoyment a lot
Would you and your girlfriend just be able to give that a look?
It's just a little form that I will give to Mr
You can prepare some questions if you want
So we're actually just doing this big push right now to increase our average results of anyone that bought something from us
I don't know if that's gonna be a deal breaker
Okay, understood. And what about your girlfriend?
I mean I don't even make that much yet
At what time? You said 6:00 PM
So wow, you're a hundred percent right
So that's just gonna take a few minutes
We can really do some business together, <affirmative>, or I can provide some valuable information
Oi and I look forward to hearing how it goes for you
My dad is already 64, my mom is 49, they're giving me everything I need to be a man in this world
Really looking at it as buying my time back
And I think I have all that
And can you read me the full name on the card?
I need to get off the boat
But let's say worst case scenario's, 20 days a month at $130 a night, that's $2,600
So what about making memories your kids? What about that is so driving for you?
Cool, Mike. Sounds good. Good getting to know you and just enjoy the rest of your weekend.
I don't know, man, I really don't feel comfortable giving that over the phone.
Time is money and it's typically a thousand dollars slot
And so there's different things and different things that I wanna do
All right. Well Jalen, dude, I appreciate it. I look forward to hearing how it goes and I'll be ready man, for Thailand
That'd be perfect. I will watch it. A 12 minute video, no problem. Yeah,
So they have to do with how the person thinks and the specific mental models that they operate with towards their Airbnb business
So you wanna be tied down to location
Well it should be all the context that our executive consultant, Mr
Yeah, so basically once you show up to the call, our team will start processing that refund for you
For sure, man. For sure. Have an awesome night and I'll send over that video after this.
You can partner with them, you can offer them more money, you can just find a different landlord
How, any other thing to just get out rolling, trust me, I have no problem with that
So just to be clear, in the past we purposely manage the properties so that there was no free cash flow
We could do a 1230 or an 11 Eastern time tomorrow
So is there any reason why you wouldn't be able to make that call on Saturday?
So your world, let's just say you weren't running into any roadblocks or boundaries
I'm actually just doing this big push right now
No, he won't, but I will.
I actually am sending you a text message right now with the email that we have on file
So you really know what it's like.
Yeah, that sounds a good plan.
I'm gonna send you over one or two videos that you can watch
We only book these out about 48 hours in advance
But that one I kind of fixed up and flipped it and then put into another property
So I was making phone calls back, Oh, end of July, August
Maybe the end product will be for me to subscribe to something more or I don't know
Well we actually don't personally run credit scores
And this is why I updated December 12th.
Goer, just make sure that anyone I place on his calendar like this watchers an important pre-call video beforehand
It would mean a whole lot Like you. A whole lot?
I, I'd like to get me 10 or 15 units under my belt right quick and rock and roll
Per year. I know probably 30 to 60 would be high end.
Yeah. And our entire focus is, it seems like the more focus on making our students successful the faster we grow.
<affirmative>, you sent me a text this number and he's like, Hey Thomas, something came up
So as long as you show up to the appointment, you'll be fully refunded
I mean, there's no limit. If I tried this and was successful to make 15, 20,000 a month even why not vote even larger
Well so you're excited to take advantage
Said, that includes, what would you say? Go ahead.
What would you do with another 20 to $30,000 a month coming in?
Yes, please do. Yes, send it to my email.
Seven 50. And you said you're retired right now. How long have you been retired for?
So I got a bunch of a plan B
And then there's another video that gives more background on Brian and kind of what he did and how he did it
So the company I work for right now is advanced ceramic component supplier manufacturer
All right. Lemme give him a call,
See this Saturday, I mean this Friday we work till 5:00 PM Would there be a time after that?
<laugh>, you like this don't you? <laugh>?
If I bought something like that, my gosh, shit, I don't know. It was a long time ago.
I would say about changes every year, I'd say about 200 K average.
So it looks like we are booked up for the rest of today, but we do have a few thoughts open tomorrow
Yeah. So how long ago did you move here?
And well, you're saying that that's valid, right? It's like you gotta have the right knowledge and the right strategy.
No, I will have my phone on me. Do you know what number beautiful you're gonna be calling?
So do you have a ballpark range credit?
Not in our system. We keep our call system in our payment processing system separate. So we actually can't access your number.
Okay. And you're currently doing long term rentals in those?
And we love the Airbnb operation and we're very, very active in it
And then I'm gonna put you with Mr
I mean, here's my thought process on our team
I know people that have done that and it seems like it's, It works
I get to spend a lot more time as far as with my family and doing other things and just enjoying life
So he's really great at helping people figure that out, that part of Airbnb out
So I'm kind of wondering for you, what's that ideal monthly income that you're hoping to get out of an Airbnb business?
Stuff like that. So Airbnb B, the low startup costs and stuff really intrigues me, so.
No, they're not gonna call you randomly
There's some huge things in there that could be incredibly profitable for you down the line
Tempes has the context that he needs to help you figure out what kind of leases you'd be able to get approved for
I don't know. I don't remember if I got the book or not.
And the folks that are just always chasing money and building up their investments hardly ever get there
Trust me, I definitely want one, if I could close on a deal tomorrow, it really just comes down to having that down payment.
I mean don't get me wrong, it's good and six figures a month is unreal but I can't do it forever
You need other assistant, you need your partners to come commit or somebody hands on <affirmative> get you
How long do you think it's gonna take for you to get there?
And currently though, you're at the place where that is the case, right? It's stressful and yeah
Okay. And you guys work mostly, I mean are you working with clients and customers in all 50 states at this point? And
Yeah, I'll actually send you a text
Like that's really what it's for
So yeah, that was my mistake
All right, you all right? You're welcome, Shta. Have a nice day.
So doing that stuff, being able to travel, go snowboard, do all that stuff
Oh yeah, she can watch it with you
All right, well there should be all the context that Mr
Okay. Be here. Wally, what time zone are you in?
Well thank you so much Thomas
Oh, I'm good. How you doing,
I don't see a reason why I have pens and got passwords
And you like playing background music pretty loud
Usually it's something they're looking to accomplish
So it sounds like for you Airbnb is the thing
I'm working towards cleaning some things up and maybe trying to rent some of that out
Well, I mean I guess I saw
Yeah, I mean not specifically but I mean there are things,
That's why I look at it
Well let's take 30 seconds here and we'll get something to confirm the calendar and then I'll let you go into work
We can wrap this up pretty quick
Ahead and go ahead and check what you wanna check. Yeah,
All right, well let's hear it.
10,000. Okay, fine. So yeah, basically the way my business works, did you get my link?
One guy, his sister passed away and he had his family
It looks just from what I can see here, looks like you got about on September 6th is when you bought the book
I'm glad we connected and helped you out with this
Something, yeah, at least I could start that's making me money without having me do everything physically punching the clock and things like that
Yeah, okay. I like it, man. And so this is your jump into the world of entrepreneurship and really the freedom and being your own boss.
Awesome. So be able to go through that, take some notes.
Only reason I ask is the video is very important
And I look forward to hearing how it goes for you
If it was there, I missed it
We're constantly revised ideas like hey, that's do this
So I just wanna make sure we're on the same page here that you mentioned creative financing
Me and my partners I have we got approved for cultivation license for marijuana
All right, well do me a favor, just pull up Monday real quick, pull up your calendar, just see what you got going on
And so I will get you actually personally connected with our customer support manager
And then the second main thing they look at when you're gonna get a lease or mortgage is your annual verifiable income
Okay. Give about 20 seconds here and we can get you confirmed for that time.
It's 4 3 39 3 1 9 1 9 1 72. Expiration date is 1 25.
What's like that ideal monthly income you'd be hoping to get to with an
So is there any reason at all,
But mainly just because they weren't able to get started or they just didn't take that action
So it looks like those properties are going for about 140 a night to about $200 a night
Do you have any sources of income coming in? What does it look like for you right now?
Do you want me to share it?
So there might just be a couple steps you gotta take in that direction if you're gonna get any closer to that goal. Right?
Something deeper in your mindset, what do you mean by that?
But let's get something on the books for Monday, if that works for you
There you go. That's your entertainment for the night.
And the reason we do that is obviously wanna just protect everybody's time
With the hundred hour cancellation and then the videos and everything
My goal bro, I'm sorry, what was your first name?
Okay, cool. Only wanna lock this in if you're at a 10. So let's do it and remind me your time zone,
I'll send you that right after this but I can pull some strings and move some things around
I got one guy, he's a millionaire, he does it
And you're totally normal, so don't worry about that
We're talking people who are putting in the bare minimum per week
Yeah, What time zone are you in
Stratton and to make sure everyone's time is being respected today
I did my own thing, I figured it out
I don't have a specific number in mind.
Okay, so those are all the times for tomorrow
Yeah, you should be able to get some really good proper with that
And I realized that, you know what? I gotta work on my own dream
We also teach people exactly how to overcome those common objections you're gonna get from landlords and how to find the right ones
But yes, all of it is thanks to Brian
I do see some serious opportunity in helping you get to that next level
It's a possibility was when I first looked into it through Cody Spur reference I thought it was another good opportunity for passive income <affirmative>
I don't have to really, my day would be playing better like this
No, at this moment, no. My income comes solely from my two legs. <laugh>.
Yeah and we, we've actually changed the way we do the coaching
But in terms of the immediate, I wouldn't be able to do anything, especially for one hour
So let's just say $20,000 minus and then 50, I probably made about 50 to 45, which still is great
It's almost always totally life changing and it's just downhill from there at that point
Yeah, you can speed it up if you need to, but I would recommend RO on one x speed
So for you, say you were in a perfect world, you didn't have the boundaries or restrictions of time, things like that
You ordered Brian Page's book on how to start an Airbnb business a few months ago. Do you remember how to create financial
So Victor, you're locked in, everything's good to go
Now here I've got a couple resources
We could do later in the week too.
And then the other part is actually coming up with the money to pay for a lease or the capital
It's been on hold cuz of shifting work locations, <laugh>. I build power lines sometimes it's not in my backyard.
<affirmative>, make family gatherings and all that
I don't think I'd like to be an agent right now
Yeah. Is it what you wanna be doing or you do you wanna be doing something else?
Yeah, but she, she's back on I think coming back Sunday night
Brian Page, we talked about leasing properties a lot leasing them and putting 'em on Airbnb, which is usually the model he teaches
I've been actually trading the markets a little bit, so I kind of sold my place
So you know what, actually, let me see something really quick
I bought the book, it was cheap as cheap as heck, and I never looked at it
So Cric, do you know what your credit score is offhand? Like a ballpark number?
And he told my manager outside of acquiring new properties, he only works five to six hours a week
Oh, okay. I didn't do it right. Okay, add to. Okay. Do you see that? I did it.
But I try not to use my money at all
Getting the first one is definitely a big part of it
This is what I'm here for
Gotcha. Do you have about 45 minutes available at 11:00 AM?
That's the reality of the market out here
Cuz I don't wanna force you into it at all just cuz I got you guys on the phone
Alright, so I definitely have the email address because let's see, Airbnb Formula b a B, right? Airbnb formula form you
Be connected to Connected Sound like an amazing sound, like an amazing anybody's working in the VA's working the va
I guess maybe you could tell me if you have some experience with it, how it's working out for people
<affirmative> and then Airbnb deals with the headaches
So I work full time at a church and so as you work at a non-profit, sometimes you'd always make the most money
That's just kinda like the process
Is that something you'd wanna do?
Typically it is a thousand dollars time slot
<affirmative>. Okay. Okay. All right. Yeah, sounds good.
Okay, gotcha. And I know you said you had a business credit card. Is that the only credit card that you have?
All right. 4:00 PM Thursday. Cool. And is there any reason you wouldn't be able to make that call?
You said you got back home from work, so it's probably been a long day
I'm on the eastern time zone.
Where do you think that comes from that the standard you set for yourself?
It has to be all pleasurable
And you're able to, let's see here, get this in and just is to double confirm before I left in here tomorrow
But what I make as far as what my company brings in stuff and what I profit together is about 1 75 to two
I'm gonna send over a calendar invite to your email, Raymond
And so that's where, that's the impass we currently having
<affirmative>, Well I'll tell you what we can do
Cause like I said, I'm in business, I'm in business
But one of my goals is to help our new students jumpstart their businesses and get some results right off the bat
Well, hey, I mean yeah, the timing is on on man. Well, the
I went through some of it and yeah, I did but it's been a while.
Yep. No, no, no. At gmail.com.
Right now I do have to take a look at their calendars first, but how does all that sound?
Is I, I know that you guys have some sort of coaching program and I don't know how much it costs and all that
To be honest, we haven't gotten that far yet
I mean, I guess eventually when I would get there would be, I don't know, 5,000 if I could in a month,
Ain't nobody getting rich like that overnight and three, four months and stuff like that
All right, Erica Achi, so take it easy
You'd be crazy if you see that list, you'd be like all those places you wanna go
I'm gonna send you a text after this
I've had this number for I don't know how long
Do you mind helping me fill that out real quick?
So would it be too much to ask for you to watch those videos say today or tomorrow before your call?
Seven, eight is lit for me
We got the system down like Ryan talks about
So you looked out on that one, man, it's, It's awesome
Oh yeah. Round trip of all everything paid for. Be priceless.
Her name's and she'll definitely call you and call you a few times if you don't pick up, definitely get through to you
You and your girlfriend be able to watch that before you speak to him tomorrow?
So that with the Airbnb before when I looked into that I wasn't doing sales yet
And Shta, with that being said, I know at least for me personally, it's pretty easy to miss an unknown number calling you
Monday? I know I have a one o'clock meeting on Monday, so anything after one o'clock is okay. Okay.
Alright, well listen I wish you the best and everything and I appreciate you reaching out and thinking of me
Stays in? He travels a lot, but he's in San Diego often in Los Angeles.
I mean dude, is that something you'd want to do?
Oh shoot, we just had a couple cancellations literally this afternoon. That would be the best time. Can you do two 30 this afternoon?
If you're not able to show up to the call focus, you know, just randomly cancel or no-show something like that
So if something had my grandbaby be set, my kids be set obvious to travel, I'm simple
I mean, if you're doing it free of charge, of course I would definitely enjoy that
No, no, go ahead. Reason you're reaching out. Go ahead.
Jackson, just make sure a hundred percent anyone that I place on his calendar does watch a mandatory pre-call video beforehand
Well that should be all the context that our executive consultant needs to figure out what's best for you
And the reason why we have that policy in place is just obviously because we want to protect our executive consultant time
I also have a corporation that it's with my son and my nephew, so I was trying to bring that into it also
So I'd say six 70 is a fair average there
Yes sir. So can I call you at any time if I just so wanted to or how's that work?
And the only other thing is that Mr
At this point? Just so I can quit my job would be, it'd be like six, 7,000 a month.
They need look at my cycle score
It's called a set up to get paid all that so I can make the money
Good. Who am I speaking with?
Hey, haven't talked to you guys in a while,
Brian Page is basically giving me the green light here to do whatever I can to raise our average student results
Let's say that the rental property is $2,000 a month
On average I make about two
There wouldn't necessarily be all these different requirements for having to deal with
I can put you with Mr
One of em is already paid for, so I rent it out for a thousand dollars and that's 100%
Cuz it just sounds like you want to build up this real estate portfolio that you're talking about
And that one property is cap on the low end about $1,500 a month
Like I said, enough to where I don't care about spend money on stuff
Probably. I mean 20 K a month.
But for you, what do you think you would do if you had a lot more free time
Oh actually you guys are not too far away from Blythe actually
Hey, do you remember he's the author of the b B Formula book
Trying new foods, meeting new people
That's a loaded question cuz I've stayed at three Airbnbs in my lifetime and two of them were the worst experience I ever had
It's one 30. Yep. One 30 right now. 1 33. Okay,
<affirmative>? Yeah, we're actually, well, we have a team
Only reason I have my email super important just to kinda Yeah, yeah, yeah
Cause <laugh> you don't even get into that job so that for all to make the money back that they spend on college anyway
And so if you like, what obstacles have you been running into with Airbnb?
Rob Smith which this guy's awesome
Gosh, I hope it's in there
It's just the best way to go about it there
I'll go ahead and email that over to you and great getting to know you and we'll talk soon
So my apologies, I'm just excited
Appreciate it. Right. Enjoy the rest of your lunch and we'll talk to you soon.
But it was probably a long time ago
Three bedroom, three bath, entire townhouse $203 a night
But yeah, I'll be back with y'all,
You ever ordering Brian Page's book on how to start a Airbnb business? About two and a half months ago,
I wanna travel, there's things I wanna do
Yeah, I can watch it beforehand.
And she's like, Yeah, yeah <affirmative>, but then she's not doing anything
And all you need is the right system and process <affirmative> like, I'm excited for you, man
How early could we go on Monday?
Even UK had five or six different what you call it surges of infection
Actually wanna do it. I would.
Well here's what we can do for you
Honestly, you know what, cause other mic I have is super, super sensitive
Okay, Would that be two words or one word? Airbnb
Sorry Weston, you cut out there for just a second.
Oh, I'm a disciple of the Sandler sales system and they're all about that
We're not gonna charge you for that, but just for ghosting and no show, that's when those fees come into play
Okay. And what are you doing right now for work?
Cause my sons, it goes back to them.
Yeah, we just ask actually that for the full 60 minutes that which we have your attention cause Mr
We can try to help you with.
The book is only about 10 pages
Seven, Last time I checked I was at maybe a seven 14 or something.
I would definitely do educational programs for children within the city
Would it be long term? I don't know
And we also had a personal trainer that was assigned to people one on one
Yeah, no, and the call is a hundred percent free
I mean nothing you'd buy and have something there that can be passed down far after you
But I don't know for the time I can put it in that I can make it happen
I don't know how, God, I think that was even before Covid 19
Cause that's how you got the book and the audiobook
Sure, I've been looking at properties for 30 years. I love doing
And I'd hate for to say that, but I'm not worried about that
Well maybe it takes some pressure off and I can go and travel and visit them where we just be around each other
So can you just commit to watching that before you're calling Friday?
Then you have two hours before someone shows up and it's like, whoa
These guys are a lot more equipped to actually get new results than I am
So earlier on a separate note, Patric, you said that you're hair size right now and if you mm-hmm
That's awesome that you want to do that
I don't wanna miss my kids growing up and you know what I mean?
Do you see that? Either that or you can see a link to add to your Google
So we're just balls to the wall with flipping right now
Either allow ourselves to grow or not.
Some of the hottest markets with Airbnb right now
You too. Bye-bye. All right, bye.
And another one we're probably gonna rent out
Net 15 net. Why don't you shoot for that?
My name's Leer and it's f o u r gmail.com. Leer four.
I'll send that over to you right now
I'll get you introduced with her so that she can get all the schedules over to you right away
Right? Yeah. Netting 30 to 40 K a month. Yeah, most definitely. Would you? I do. With the extra income coming in?
So the last thing I'm required to do is just fill out a couple things here so that Mr
700. Okay. Also a ballpark here, but what's your current annual income?
It looks like we have you based outta Columbia, Tennessee right now
You should see inside of one of the emails a link to add to your calendar.
I would yeah, I'd talk to somebody for an hour. Yeah.
We've been to the West coast to see the ocean two times
I'll go ahead and send that to you right now
Now obviously if that's the case, that does require a higher level of investment
Oh yeah, looked at, I did the math. It's extremely lucrative, so it's not so difficult to get into reading. So that's why
By the way, if that does happen, we just charge to the cards that we have back from when you got the book.
Well, if you replace my income
How come you don't t? Yeah. And how come you'd move your sister out there and your mom?
Okay. All right. I'm gonna keep your phone number and your name in my phone book.
Just the more money you have, I feel like the more secure and the more opportunities
So one last thing I'm required to do, just fill out a little form here
It says that the booking is confirmed. Scheduling this meeting was easy. Do you want people to schedule meetings with you? It has the booking details.
Yeah, well you know what actually
Just for myself, I don't know how much time I can give, so, Yep
<laugh>. Let's do it man. Let's do it. I wanna see you back and back on a call with Catherine in two weeks from now. Okay,
And yet I understand that if I don't, I'm never gonna accomplish anything
No, I said I'd say I No, no, no, no. I said I have to take a look at their calendars first.
And just so you know, okay I got an hour to the call
It's gonna be bad for me this week
12 months now. $12,000. How many properties do I have to have managed?
I have a partner that I purchased 11 places with
Just cause I know your time is valuable and so is Mr
And also just how you go into it with your mindset and making sure to break down any limiting beliefs
No, I can. No, I can certainly make that call.
I mean, like I said, man, I think it's valuable to listen to someone that's doing it. I mean
You said earlier you said financial freedom and actually first to clarify, Noah, I work with Brian Page
You know what I mean? I haven't dug into it like that in a little while
All right, We'll talk to you later. Unique.
For sure, man. And how do you see yourself enjoying life if you had more free time, if you had another income stream?
I'm not sure how they're with the store people
Really. How many hours you working a week? Right now?
I will pay all her medical bills. Take her out.
I usually end up trying new things
So do you mind helping me fill that out real quick? Just three quick questions
But can I be completely honest with you, Brian? The book is super basic
We could probably cover more that's in that book in about five minutes over the phone, to be completely honest with you
People are always telling me that was super valuable, like super gratefully have me watching that beforehand
I'll I'll get the work done on our side
Jackson know that you're committed to watching that video and you're ready to go at 11:00 AM Is that fair? Yep
Essentially, at the most simplest form is you can go out and sometimes people buy properties, a lot of times Brian recommends renting them
You got Brian's course well back in starting the Airbnb business
What's the b B formula process? Cause I haven't taken a look at it in a while or at all really
Well, I guess it depends as you be signing both you and her on the lease.
So we're doing this big push to increase the average results of anyone that got something from us
So you guys are on the same page
Cool. Gotcha. Would that be possible?
Unlimited is the goal way up there, but obviously it's definitely important to have some checkpoints along the way too
I'm doing wonderful. Melee, if you recall, you got Brian's course a while ago on starting Airbnb business. Does that ring a bell?
So if that really wasn't b B wasn't on the table, my honest answer would be to keep pursuing
So really Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursdays sort of out
So ideally, cuz it sounds like you're working a lot evenings and stuff like that
If I don't hear from you in the next two hours, I'll just give you a call
Stratton know that you guys will both be there and you guys be watching the video and I'm excited to see how it goes
So I have a couple buddies
You I'm sure you got some yourself I'm sure.
Cause we know that out of a hundred thousand copies of that book that were sold, most people didn't do anything with it
Do you want me to share it?
I'm only making what my job's giving me right
And it's not like I wouldn't mind putting in time to do it
I have big interest in the trucking industry
Hold on one second. Wait, did I actually, no, I don't know if I wait
That's why I'm on a road now, but it's hard to find drive quality driver
Yeah, I've got three availabilities left tomorrow afternoon or noon.
Three to 4,000 a month. <affirmative>. Gotcha. Is that where you're cash flowing off of it?
We purchase TVs for the house and all get spectrum set up
Looks like we have a 12:00 PM or 1:00 PM Central time for tomorrow
Put you in here with Mrs
All righty. Thank you so much.
Perfect. You'll be able to go through that video, maybe take some notes, jot down a couple questions,
Stratton has what he needs to help figure out what kind of leases you can get approved for
Cool. So you want me to break down how that would go and see if I can find some availability in the calendar?
If it's something that is good for me in my family, something that we can possibly scale
Perfect. I'll email that out to you right here. I've got Nathan Lee Jones 89 gmail.com.
Could you pull it up and accept it?
So could you fill that out really quick? It's just a few questions
I really value being able to make that time tomorrow, so
Be consulting call. Okay. Okay. Yep,
So here's kind of my thought process on this
So for you man, were you able to get started with Airbnb or what's going on?
To be honest with you, just to see if I can do it
Go ahead and that right now
We trying to give you some great information so you guys could be on the same page and just have a great call
So I'll have more passive residual income, so
Like that to put a plan together starting Monday
We got a lot more people looking for Airbnbs and people supplying Airbnbs
A lot and go see all the seven wonders of the world and go spend some time in the tropics. Never been there.
Yeah, of course. Nice to meet you too. All right, take care.
Okay. So it sounds like you kind of still need a clear path.
So the only reason we do that, so Matt Renzi, he's an absolute superstar, he's gonna clear 1
Lancer is available for that time
Sense. And then to track that as well from what I made. But I didn't get 8,000 worth of service
The second one is manufacturer home that I'm paying 5 84 just to rent the land
Yeah, check your calendar, make sure no no conflicting calls. You've got 60 minutes to be able to sit down.
What's stopping you from getting to the Airbnbs and hitting 10 K a month? Man
And then I'm allowed to hook people up with some pre resources or whatever
Last time? I checked those. 7 67.
But in a perfect world we'd be looking to get some sort of result out of what we read in a book
Cool man. And do you go by Tori or Torrance?
I know how it can get, I know how it can get up in Washington, up in British Columbia this time of year especially
Hey Brian. It's Cooper with Bmb Formula. Come on. Brian Page's team. How you doing?
Well, the thing about it is at the airport I have it open for now, but it may not be tomorrow
Yeah, I'm looking forward for you and I'll let assist you.
So the average property every, it's about 15 a month
Yes, I can for sure go through that. I can go through that tonight or either first thing Monday morning.
Just cuz we do have a policy to charge a hundred dollars cancellation fee for these appointments
I mean they're far more equipped at actually getting you results than I am
Sure. I'm still on the call. Right. So
Who ever got well lost rather than rich that quick? That's what make it sound so poy
I live a modest life, a very modest
And so five to 10 is my goal
Brian Page was like fuming and the success manager got pretty burned
I think that principle I've certainly found to be true
Glad we gotta connect here and I think I may have a super solid idea of how we can help you
Cause I follow so many people cause I'm always
I got sidetracked by some other things
I mean, thought it was just a ton of great ideas
All right. And typically a consulting call might last 45 to 60 minutes. Do you have that much time available on 1230?
I mean they'll give you a guarantee, but a guarantee ain't nothing
And at the end of the day, my expenses per home comes out to be about 25 to $2,600 a month
What we found is that most of them never ended up having success simply cuz they didn't get started
Like I said, man I got a little janitorial business, I'm doing that right now, but it's been kinda up and down
We'll get you booked in here
That's a good 60 k, a good quality of life
They would get one new property every 45 days that on average net, some about $1,500 a month
Working on that. So I don't know if that's a requirement, but
So I was trying to crush her as much as I can so far asleep
So I mean, I may start off small, but I know eventually it'll take off and when it does it's only up from there
I'm a hundred percent interested in this so definitely not gonna ve on it
It would just open up other horizons for anything, whatever else, whatever else comes I guess, if you will
Are you guys based outta Arizona or guys? Is that where you guys do your stuff? I don't know
And how much passive income do you think you'd need per month to be able to be where you want to be comfortably?
I mean, tomorrow would be better.
Just living. That's it. Nothing big, nothing huge and exciting. It's just comfortable. We're just comfortable
So it's got a lot of really cool stuff, but cool man
Perfect. And you have you all my contacts.
Oh yeah, it is. It's gonna be a party <laugh>, they don't have a party, they're have a good party.
Pretty much, yeah. I'm stuck in a, but I'm doing the best I can.
Yeah, we can do that. Can you email me the link or appointment
I'm a operations manager for a medical waste company
So I don't currently have one at the moment
So chip sets and stuff like that
So actually our top guy, Jake, he actually does have a slot open on 3:00 PM on Thursday
If I don't, I'm fine with that as well
I'm 22 years old, man, I'm 22 years old, my wife is 21
Fair enough. Well, hey, what would you do with an extra 20 to 30,000 a month coming in from Airbnb?
Oh we're doing this combined or is it just me? By myself
Nah, my schedule should be pretty clear, but in the afternoon.
I think it's just my time commitment to my work
Yeah. Yeah it has. I play volleyball over there and everybody really likes those houses and it's be very convenient for me.
So right now you guys are living off your income and you still are in the process of getting some Airbnbs up and running
Okay, awesome. Sean Rashaun, I love talking to you man, and I'm so sad to see where you go from here.
And honestly, you can do it faster than that
Then I ended up getting another credit line with line or something like that
Tell me, it sounds like we may be in this position here, so
I'm in I'm over in Miami
If they got a three day stay or something like that, at least make a thousand dollars
Okay, awesome. 10:00 AM tomorrow. Got you in there. And now part of
This is going on my second year.
Hey Michael. It's Cooper with Bmb Formula on Brian Page's team. How you doing?
Ideal or realistic? I mean ideally probably anywhere from 10 to 20 a month would be ideal.
Okay. Eastern Washington. As far as Spokane or somewhere in the middle.
He's transformed a lot of people
I was looking when I was back when I was going to due springing break up there
Gone. Oh, So sounds like you're having trouble actually finding the course and getting access to that.
And then a part, and I'm gonna put you with Mr
You said, do you me to fill out or you going ask and
I mean, yeah, but doesn't mean I wanna send it.
And then within six months you're at $6,000 a month and within 12 months you're at $12,000 a month
They read a little bit of the book and they just don't have any external force or accountability to help them get started
For example, a lot of investors come in and buying these properties
Okay. I have a four 30 or a five. Maybe we do the five o'clock just to be safe.
I am in the middle of driving. I can't really talk right now or pay good attention to what you're saying.
We've noticed that in California the laws are pretty relaxed in San Francisco
That's awesome. And Thailand, that it, That's such an amazing place. And are you thinking more jungles in Thailand or city area?
All right, man. Take it easy. Thank you.
Sometimes that's not just you as an individual
I'll send you a calendar invite but for sure you, you'd be able to do that tomorrow five 30
Yeah, that sounds awesome. I wanna sign up for this.
And so my only job is to increase the results of folks that bought the book
And it sounds like you have a great plan going there
I've got a pretty diverse portfolio most of which are smart contract coins. My biggest holding right now is V chain it's b e t
Hey I got a question for you
So right now, Jay, has there been, what has been the missing piece with Airbnb? Cause it sounds like
Because, because I like to refresh myself on the wine in the closet and the maid's closet and with the lock and all that stuff I
Yeah, yeah. I'd probably either try to continue scaling with the Airbnb model or maybe get into another form of real estate investment.
Okay, gotcha. And then is that all self, it was all like self-employment income, like 10 99 or no,
Seven 70. Okay. All right. And then what's your gross annual income at the number you'd be putting on your tax return last year?
So if you're not able to show up to the call focus, you just randomly cancel no show something like that
Okay, well first question, do you have any idea what your credit score is at right now?
Well it was a nice house actually
Yeah, I mean don't worry about that
No, because there's a huge increase in demand for Airbnb hosts
Okay so I'm looking at let's see, maybe I don't have the right Matt. I say Matt Ramey and then say Airbnb.
And then only other thing before the call is Mr
So yeah, I haven't had the time to get into it, but I certainly would still certainly am still interested
I'm just tired of working for people
And so <affirmative>, this is a good enough number for them to give you some direction
I'm going to email you the ebook of the book very soon, and so I wanna make sure that you can get that
My dad's telling me stories about, dad tells me stories about being in there and being in there
And the only other thing before the call is Mr
And so it looks like we do have a few spots open on Wednesday
Yeah. Slow man. I love that area. One of my buddies that works at Pit Viper, he lives there. He does the marketing.
Let's get you those leads and I get you back into Airbnb man
I'm not taking my wallet out of a purse next time
I could probably drive a newer vehicle
But I mean I telecommute, I make a great living
So the question is, what are you gonna do with it now? So go for it
I know that one of our consultants would definitely want her on the call because we always like to answer their questions
In the Covid era that we're have, I mean how are you guys addressing? Have you your curriculum at all, do you address?
Airbnb provides hosts with about a million dollars of insurance
Like I said I'm right now I'm spending money to make money
All right, We'll get you confirmed in for that right now
Let's hope this booking goes through
It's something that I always wanted to do and I know a lot of people enjoy
I just have to take a look at the calendar first
That's freaking cool that that's what you want to do
I can't guarantee 'em gonna have zero distractions but that's not entirely up to me. But yes.
He does not like to take risks at all
<affirmative>. And how many hours between you and the wife, how many hours are you guys putting into the Airbnb business?
And you're reading all this stuff people write and all this stuff people say and stuff
Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Understood. And how much debt are you in?
At one time when I called I had some money, but I don't have anything to put in
I think you already sent an invite, didn't you? Or no, did
So I mean this guy's really the limit on this man
That's really just cause they didn't do anything
May have in the e-book version
However, it's going to yield a significant cash flow if I owned one
One of them will just say your booking's confirmed
I appreciate you being able to do that
We charge it to the card that we have on file back when you got the course but shouldn't be an issue for you
A lot more availability on those days. What day do you wanna look at?
But I'm also gonna, I'm have my other friends stay here
Okay, cool. I can definitely get you in. Okay, so Kristen, what time zone are you in?
And you said you wanted to give back to your family, kind of build that generational world, be one of the first ones, right?
70. That's 70 K right now. $70
Right now you mentioned location, so can you kinda explain to me the details and how is that impacting you being able to do Airbnb?
So dude, I'm soaked to you
Which isn't as common these days actually.
What's like the next level beyond that?
You'd be able to learn a lot from this guy
What about anything family, anything other than that you need to take care of?
Okay. Sounds like you're getting going with flips, but down the road that would be nice and haven't done haven't started just yet with Airbnb, right?
Will. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Go ahead.
Really? Yeah, I mean, like I said, I believe in the whole system a hundred percent
That's awesome. I'm just curious cause I love a lot of stuff. In that same vein what do you feel called to specifically about helping children?
But yeah, just kind of playing this freaking waiting game
Only terrible if it's gonna take longer than 10 minutes.
I'd like to see that. Yeah. Yeah,
Time is, Okay so I think you're in central then and Kentucky cause we're, I'm out here in Arizona right now so it's five
And the bank account statements is to show if you don't have enough payment history
And generally speaking, because my bills are so high running the business, I need to make that six figures to break even
So you wanna make that available
So I'm allowed to hook you up with some free resources to make that happen to help you out
L a n c e r is my last name
At the point you have a hundred, 500 Airbnbs, you're just making just ridiculous amounts of money at that point
Okay, cool. What time zone are you in?
What was it that got you excited about Airbnb in the first place?
And I'll also send over a calendar invite to your email right now that you can accept later on today
Yeah, you're enough. It's close, it's good. Oh yeah. Ryan,
<affirmative> invitation. And then on that invitation email you'll see a link to added to your Google calendar.
The program I'm already in the program is pretty much the program is done once you get the information from it
So if you're not able to show up to the call focus, you just randomly cancel no shows, something like that
And so I'm gonna send over a calendar invite to your email and n e gmail
And then by the time you're at 12 months, it's 12, you're making $12,000 a month in profit passively
So I can lock that in for you
Okay, gotcha. Why Costa Rica? Out of anywhere?
Yeah. Yep, that's my zip code
So I mean that's pretty damn lucky
So first question, do you know a ballpark range of what your credit score's at?
Keep someone on standby and let me live
Is that kind of why you're interested?
So for you, in a perfect world, no boundaries, what was the ideal income you were hoping to get to?
And we get about one property every 45 days, and our average property is netting about $2,000 a month
I believe that, I believe that after this phone call, that this could be a change of trajectory for you
Yeah, 10:00 AM on Wednesday. Gotcha. You can email me the appointment too, right? The link or whatever I gotta
You know, miss a lot of stuff
Okay. All right, You too Cooper. Appreciate it.
I'd be curious for you, I mean, was there something that got you excited about Airbnb a while back?
Oh you sound a little bit hesitant
So I just want them to enjoy their life to the fullest without having to keep going fucking back to work man
I'm kinda looking into that now cause I've been looking at videos and stuff like that
After one O' we can 4:00 PM We can 4:00 PM
I mean that would be nice, but I highly doubt that'll happen.
Yeah, yeah, because it was later on in the year I was talking to other, I talked to a couple different people
There's areas where you don't rent out anyone for a little bit
<affirmative> design, staging oh nine, That's what I like to be able to do
Thinking two grand a week would cut it. Or not a week Every two weeks, sorry.
I'm trying to get a resort, so that's the goal. Oh, yours resort.
So if you wanted to snag an hour spot there, we can do that
To start this business or for the phone
Okay, so it's not huge amount of profits you had
Hey Travis, this is Thomas with b and B Formula
And I mean they're light years ahead of me actually work directly with Brian Page
What was that? Sorry, I didn't hear you.
<affirmative>. How do they expect you to be working?
And the next actually probably the next few weeks
Yeah, so I'm just gonna message her to make sure that we can get that out here for you
So I have a three 30 or a four o'clock, what would be best for an hour call
Okay. So I'm still confused right
Okay, awesome. Where would you go?
But obviously any additional income is additional income
Having to multiply while you sleep
Yeah. Why Airbnb specifically? What makes you think that you can be successful with that?
I was even lucky I even had it down, to be honest with you
You can a hundred percent show up, fully focused, zero distractions, pen and paper ready, take some notes
Which is the automation, the delegation
Okay. All right. I've got a Monday at five 30, wanna lock that in.
Yep. Yep. I know the industry is scattered with some bogus programs out there, so I totally understand your concern. Totally understand.
And just so you know, the way it works, it's super simple
That feels good right now whenever you manage to retire your parents finally
What he does, especially helping people who are looking to get into it and you already have a property, which is great
I'm gonna reach out to our support gal, Diane right now and we, we'll get you your login information
So could you help me take down a few notes on some of those numbers for Mr
You know what I'm saying? To be honest with you, I'm really not expecting it to work out
I'm doing wonderful man. Hey Steven, do you remember spending a thousand dollars in Brian's b and B formula course while back?
You add an addendum to the bottom of that lease lease
So jet Jet, like a jet airplane, but with two Ts
Okay. Right. Okay. I get on it. Right.
Well, as the real estate market has a shifted somewhat, it's a little bit of a gilded market, you might say, <laugh>
So it is locked in and on their calendar
Honestly, a lot of people still haven't gotten started after going through the course
I always thought we had the most awesome places in America, but now I've been around the world
So it looks like, yeah they are busy the rest of the day, but we have some sauce available tomorrow and Tuesday
Well I probably would've definitely gotten those Airbnbs going and probably a salon or a barbershop.
It's kind of tough to even get started here, so I'm like, okay, maybe I gotta do this in another city
John Stratton and let's wrap it up here
So financially independent, when I ask that question, I think about my current bills
Okay, let me pull up the calendar and you're in specific time, so we're on the same time zone here
Which obviously that's a tremendous number to just break even
Yeah, I hear you. Well, question for you, how do you feel that actually having a successful Airbnb business would allow you to have those things?
Cause we see that is a huge tipping point for them
But if I can get a nine or 10:00 AM call would be perfect for me
All rental arbitrage doesn't own any of 'em
Okay. I can do an 8:00 AM slot.
If I can get a job with and around 5K in sales, then that's ideal
You say 9 9 99 doing
I'll make sure that Michael know that you're committed to watching that video
So I feel I got some context on where you're at you guys
I mean, I'd probably say an hour or two.
But 10 K per month of some units would be very nice
So this is your phone number, right? I can call back as well. This phone number?
<affirmative>. Yeah. Can't dedicate a hundred percent effort to all of 'em all at the same time.
Yeah, absolutely. I'll grab it. I know the importance of holding up your end of the deal.
Let's just get it on the calendar
So as far as these ones go, we'd be just looking at the next couple days
And for you, what would you do with an extra 10 K net coming in a month?
I've got my latest 5:00 PM in the afternoon
This is my first time that we've talked actually
If this is something you genuinely want, something you do think will be valuable for you, happy to do it
Okay. <affirmative> and is a couple thousand or more. And would you stop there or, Yeah. Gotcha.
Okay, nice. That's a good opportunity.
And so for you, I mean, were you able to get started with Airbnb or what's going on?
That. Right, exactly. So for you man, what would you do with an extra 20 to 30 K a month coming in?
Seemed like everybody and their mother now are looking to Airbnb and to this because worse getting spread and now it's like it's good
Call? Well, let me ask you this
Looks like Kentucky is actually, I think it depends on where you are in Kentucky has two time zone
So, you know what I mean? It takes time
I'm gonna pull something up here from the back end
So can you commit to watching that before your call on Wednesday?
I can work all week long
So all in all, I spent maybe $15,000 on that
I'll give you an update later on tonight whichever, Or actually I'll say, I don't know in terms of Diane, I'd be off
And with Airbnbs, did you have a specific goal in mind that you really wanted to hit in terms income with properties?
Awesome. So you already know it works now it's just figuring out how to get into it, Giving
Let's see, Friday, I don't have to clean a building
11:00 AM That's my got Tuesday. Let me me check my calendar and see what's up for Tuesday.
Yeah, that's fair. So what time zone are you in currently?
What were you looking to accomplish with it over the long run?
Well let me do this before we go any further
I had pretty good parents, they kind of always just taught me that I lost one of them recently
All right, we'll get you in there
Yeah, so essentially the pieces of information that really help is first credit score, like ballpark range, where you're at right now
What would change for you personally at 20 to $30,000 a month coming in?
What we can do instead I'll let Mr
And then how soon were you guys looking to retire? Would it be both of you or just you?
Let's see if I can get you confirmed in at 12:00 PM I'll also double check to see if they have that available
I guess just dating's not for me
Yes, sir. I I'll be up. Yeah, I mean, I
So would you have a partner in your Airbnb business
I just please be sure to do whatever you need to do to remind yourself to be on that call just like
But other than that I'm gonna hand you over to Mr
What I mean, be living good and keep reinvesting and just, I'm kind of doing the generational wealth thing
Lill. Gotcha. Hey man, this is Cooper with BNB Formula and Brian Page's team, how you doing today? Mm-hmm.
Would you want to do that?
So I just walked in the front door and I'm here at the front
And then you mentioned some investments
So I mean, would the same time tomorrow work? Would you be able to block out 60 minutes tomorrow?
So it got me thinking, let me see about this cuz here's my thought process on our team
So I'm gonna go ahead over and send over a counter invite to your king victor gmail
Of the valley@gmail.com. Okay. Gotcha. Squeaky and squeaky's just spelled, spelled regularly? Yeah. S Q U E A K Y. Yeah.
Here are the things you can do,
I'm not actually, I'm actually not just a coincidence there
So he is be able to help you out with questions you have and get some strategy stuff together for your Airbnbs
Yeah, that's what I'm here to do
It's just that some people they, they'll ask but they don't put their foot forward
I'm tired of all of that
And you still have access to it, right?
Right? Man, 5K months could be going Chick-fil-A every single day for every single meal making five months
<laugh>. Yeah for sure. Get some more. Keep growing the business.
That's basically what got me into it
Brian Page? That sounds familiar. BNB formula. Yeah. Okay, got it now. Sorry, I'm, I'm fine, how are you?
Yeah man. So just imagine, I mean what would you do with an extra 20 to 30 grand per month coming in?
And if not this is my number
Gotcha. So to that sounds like you're looking to buy the properties or are you looking at leasing them?
Okay. How many people are you helping now?
So actually a great thing in terms of that we can get into that
Would change for you? My other businesses, not much
For you say the smartest person in the world, right? There's like, there's no way you can fail
That's what the beautiful things about Airbnb actually
But I'm in Pacific, so we're just one hour behind. That's that's perfect. I can give you a call around nine or 10 mountains
But let's see, some other people have some success of this thing before I get into it
Just, Okay, so you're clearing between three and $6,000 a month on your Airbnb business
Oh, okay. So on Brian Page's website does it talk about that?
It wouldn't be me anymore, but
10:00 AM is the earliest I have.
I'll get you booked in here and it's gonna enter any information
And I think Cabo is in the lead at this point in my life
I own a hair product line at fragrance line and I operate that another 40, 50 hours a week
And so just the fact you're taking action that that says a lot about you
<affirmative> and excuse me, I know you said you're, you still work a job as well
Okay. You're willing to show up to the call fully focused, zero distractions, pen a notepad. Yeah, you'll
Yeah, that's me. <affirmative> the one. Is that the one I signed up under?
Don Stratton or sorry, sorry, eight 30 this evening
So how much would you need to be making from Airbnb to be able to leave your job?
Out the people that they've had incredible success
Well I can appreciate your transparency, Sherry
You know what I'm saying? I may have to go in and work because my responsibilities are pretty high
Yeah, because I'm pretty booked up on, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to on Tuesday, Wednesday so it's kind of unfortunate
<affirmative> and if I can train them and cause I like helping people
Could you commit to watching that before your call?
So the last, Yeah, that's the only thing
So last thing I'm required to do, just fill out a little form here so that Mr
Styberg does ask that time, I place someone on his calendar that they watch a short 12 minute pre-call video
Awesome. I appreciate it, Johnny. Dude, it's been a pleasure talking with you and I look forward to hearing how it goes.
Oh sure. I watched that. I have plenty of time to watch that. How long is the video?
That's a very precise ballpark, man. <laugh>
More than cover my expenses for sure.
Those are. So in that case,
Does that ring a bell? Do you remember that at all?
But essentially, the rental arbitrage model is what we're getting people successful with
I feel as though it'll just be a matter of time and I could definitely see that being successful in less than 365 days
So basically 12 months or 11 months
That you know can get somebody with good credit to do the process
Would you mind watching that before you hop in your call next week?
Oh no. Yeah, of course not all depending on the success and obviously getting experience on your belt, that'll definitely
The last thing before your call is Mr
<affirmative>? Yeah, for sure. Why does it gotta be you?
We found that most people never ended up having any success, but that was mainly just cuz they didn't get started mean
Yeah, I'm just getting started in it. Oh it's awesome. Yeah. And I just wanna make sure I'm saying your name right? Is it uo?
As far as the dollars or number of properties,
I mean it sounds like for you getting to 20, $30,000 a month, it's not just about making more money
Yeah, I'm on call at the hospital so I don't have any availability on that day. Do you guys make calls in the evening time?
Well I'll pass the information along to Mr
But as far as the Covid situation, so the bookings and the occupancy on Covid changed drastically when the pandemic hit
<affirmative>. Yeah, man. Tell me about that. Fixing your mother's house up. What else would you do for her?
When you're going out to get leases, they'll look at a few different things that determine what can, what you can get approved for
Put into deposits on the leases for the Airbnbs?
Alright, What's your number? So we can get this started and
Yeah. Bar park around a hundred thousand, but maybe 80, maybe 90 would be more realistic.
Are you good there? Would you keep it going if you could?
Would you mind helping me fill that out really quick?
Basically they will me that one hour consulting, free consulting for now, but I know that they're getting something else out of it
Cool. And what about six units?
What would I do with it? I don't know. Probably expand more, I would imagine.
Cause it sounds like you'd be ready to go if you just have the capital <affirmative>
Smith's calendar, he does ask that I you over video
Cause a lot of people that I talk to who are like, Yeah I just wanna save
So it sounds like the 30 k month is where you wanna get to
You wanna have that financial freedom that's ultimately what you see in your future
Work to make that happen? To go? Yeah, cause I'm just remembering umm, just remembering husband and wife kind of things
Gimme a bottle of those drugs
You guys have to trust me on that
I'm glad we gotta connect here briefly
So I was totally involved with her
I'm gonna email it to you right after this
So curious for you were you able to get into Airbnb or what's going on?
Hey, it's Cooper with B Formula on Brian Page's team. How you doing,
I've only been my current job about three months, but the target is 85.
Not that I know of right now, other than the biggest excuse I have for everybody
What I mean doing stuff and I just don't think feasible for me to continue to do for too much longer
Not scaling or really not quite getting the results they're hoping for
So for you, do you remember what kind of interested you about Airbnb in the first place when you got the book?
No, no. I just said yes, I, I'm in Central clinic.
This barn on would be probably the best you mover for you
Well, I mean, usually people don't invest about a thousand dollars into a course unless there's a specific result they're looking to get to
I will have the money to be able to get it done
I'm, I'm about a year and a half in and I'm an analyst at a company called Bellwether
What about Friday? Anything on Friday?
<affirmative> I can send you over my direct line that you can get a hold of me at
Smith needs to figure out what's best for you
See? Oh my gosh, that would be awesome.
Just when I flip houses on the TV shows, they make it look so easy but there's lots of trials
You wanna do me a favor and just pull up your schedule for tomorrow. Just take a look at what you got going on.
And yeah, I don't always wanna feel like I'm working for money all my life
Do you mind helping me figure that out real quick? That's just three questions
I have Jonathan Morales 2 9 94 gmail.com.
Well to be honest, for a lot of our students they don't get offered that just being transparent with you
Okay. I think we can keep this under 10 minutes.
So obviously the first thing to look at when you're gonna get a lease is your score. So what's your credit score at right now?
Let's see. Jaylen Time's the new end
And so of course that happens and you can't get back to where you were
That's another reason why I'm trying to do this
I'd love to get feedback once I get through that
So I dunno, I have zero experience
I can email you the link to the ebook as well, so you can, don't have to dig it out if you don't want
What do you feel like is biggest thing prevent of you from getting started with Airbnbs?
Is that why you're kind of interested in that?
If you can do something passive after you sell your business, you'd be totally stoked, right?
And that way I just have a better understanding of exactly how it could potentially help you or get you the best resources
So you create that large income, I'm sure he does
So do you mind helping me fill it out? It's just three quick questions
Make sure you get the right. I've got jack allie gmail.com.
So let me go ahead and finalize that
So I mean, once you have all this money and you have investments, it's all working for you
That includes people that purchase that book
Like I said, I'll go ahead and shoot you over that video
So looks like they book up the rest of the night
So Daniel, just ballpark range, what's your credit score?
So I got the first email that looks like the Google invite and I click yes <affirmative>
So it's not always about money
So if we could do it on Wednesday next week or Tuesday, that would be much better for me
I'm not trying to do that all my life
We have about 200 of them
I'm gonna be your tenant but I'm not gonna live there
Not a goal I personally have
So it just has the invite and the date is that you're confirming
But yeah, on Friday I'd be more likely to break away from work or late evening
All right, sounds good. All right.
Yeah, I mean if I could do that, then yes
Literally, the moment you finish the calls, then they send it back to you
I mean basically the thing is right now is the actual time, like I said, I definitely have capital to start something like this
He loves to getting bowling tournaments and things like that
You mean with the program? So I can send you over the book, actually Brian does a book, an audio book
So is there any ballpark figure you could throw out?
Cause I only wanna lock this in for you if you're at a 10
I mean you got a lot of stuff going on
I mean, isn't creating your own schedule and being your own boss, ideally, Isn't that one of your goals?
Okay, gotcha. Yeah. When you did go through the course, did you think anything about the rental arbitrage model?
So yeah, see I got it more
Temps, Just make sure that anyone I placed on this calendar watches an important pre-call video beforehand
Hey Nathan, this is Cooper with Bmb formula on Brian Page's team. How you doing?
Yeah, but I want to fine tune it to where I'm freeing up my time
Hey, this is Thomas with B Formula. Brian Page asked me to give you a call to see how you're doing on your Airbnb journey.
Gotcha. All right. Give him about 20 seconds here and I'll see if we can get you locked in for that.
So sounds like you have the condo in Florida and you own that property right now
<laugh> to be honest, I'm at a eight and I mean, I can't be fully excited until I start hearing about what they're gonna offer
I know that's something that's so big, being able to take those trips and have the freedom to do so
Oh dude, last year was super low with Covid. It was like 30 grand. It was low.
<affirmative> on one of the remotes you press skip
My perception was it was more managerial time and effort than I was willing to put into kind of get that off the ground
I mean, it definitely makes sense
Yeah. Where you stay at, Where you live at what part? What area?
Yeah, you can try. Yeah. So right now, not
You're welcome. I feel that it is, man. I feel that it is truly.
Probably like six 70 or something like that, I guess. Something like that. I
You don't know any of that stuff right now?
Well I that I can take a break away from what I'm doing or I'm working on to be able to do
Okay. What do you mean by that?
Do you have our joint credit card? Oh,
I'd have to be able to lock myself down in an area for any length of time where I could get something started
The way Brian Page teaches Airbnbs is going out and getting leases on properties and then putting them on Airbnb
I'm gonna email it to you right after that and then you can watch that right before or right after, rather
I'm kind of curious why you're doing this, if you don't mind me asking
Yeah man, I love to travel too, so I always like to ask people cause some people really like to travel and me too, man
Now I'd have to take a look at their calendars first, but how does all that sound?
Okay. And you can let me know by the end of the day and we'll just go from there. Does that sound cool?
No, I'm definitely not. Probably a nine once I have the call, probably get to a 10 when I'm halfway through, but I'm definitely there.
But as far as owning any, no I have not done that
I don't have anything going on Monday
I work in the HR department.
I feel like, I honestly feel like you could kill with this thing seriously with Airbnb
This is Thomas with BV Formula from Brian Page's team
So she's big encouragement of trying to get through
And then you pay back the landlord, the 1200 and you're left with a nice amount of profit right there
So I just wanted to be fully transparent with you and make sure that you could make it
<laugh> love to get back there, but it's like how do you do that, make that transition back. So
Awesome. I mean, yeah man my
Texas. 11. Where in Texas are you at?
Yeah. We also, you're also in mom mode as well, so,
If you're not able to show up to the call focus just randomly cancel or no show, that's really what it's for
<affirmative>. And given those numbers, does Airbnb sound like an opportunity you'd wanna possibly pursue?
Well it looks like, actually I just wanna confirm one thing before you get you scheduled in. What's your last name?
So I gave them, yeah, I gave 'em $10,000 plus other things that I did
<affirmative>. So what's the catch <laugh>?
Now I have student loans because I went to school, got my master's and I had to take loans
Just go ahead and try the card. Yeah, cause I'll try the card and if that doesn't work then we can figure out some other option.
All right, have a blessed day.
It's like, it's why I'm at this company so I'm excited for you, man
Yeah I've been kind of just pursuing my job right now I guess you could say
So is this gonna be a situation where I should be knowing more about the course before I talk to him?
Who is this Fleet? I'm sorry.
How often are you away from home?
They're looking for rent and some of 'em are worried they won't get the income
I have it on my calendar
You can tell me what's going on on the success team
You're gonna hear my garage door open
Okay. Do you know what your credit score is at
Well, so I actually just pulled up and at three o'clock our top guy, Mr
I'd have to be so big
I don't know what it is, I just suck
So I was curious are you still looking for some sort of opportunity in Airbnb or interested in passive income?
But the night job was six days a week and during the summer they opened up until 12
I was over 700, but I have my credit utilization went down to us lately and A is closer to seven 40, my wife
I also have a goal to do five lease purchase options which is a pretty cool little thing
15 years. And then what's your annual income?
I mean there's so many rules and regulations with it, so I'm
Yeah. Yeah. Panama. I lived in Panama. It's
And then, I mean, ideally you'd like to go higher than that
Lemme, I just thought I had it now
Yeah, man is definitely something that we recommend
To be honest with you, I haven't thought about it in a long time and I never really got deep enough into the thought
Yeah. Be there with Grant Cardon. Go there
And we make about $300 to a thousand bucks commission
So one last thing I'm required to do is just fill out a little form here so that Mr
Brother does ask that anyone I place on his calendar watches a pre-call video beforehand, just takes 12 minutes long
<affirmative> I think is something that property owners would look at and be like, okay, that's solid
I've got a three in the afternoon on Monday
But I wanna see where that's possible and I don't, It kind sound like a scam to me
I still basically am the sales rep for grape in the Central Valley
Why? There's a reason why is because everybody just works to live and live to work
I mean I think it totally could totally help out for sure.
So it looks like we got you in with Mr
Only reason I ask about that video is it is just super important
Trying to be a little more realistic
Okay, so that might be the first email. You may have gotten a second one.
Only reason we have you do that is it's just great information
So it looks like we did get you confirmed with Miss Catherine Funk for 4:00 PM Eastern today
So we've been kind of saving up and waiting on it, just let it stack up on it own and Gotcha
Well, right now it's hard to say because it took a long time to get started
We can do it over the phone
So do you have an iPhone?
Yeah, I mean obviously the business thing a business income and that's mine too
I have one, I got my own. Oh, you have one? I'm okay. Yeah, I'm listed on there. Yeah, I have an every, Oh
Again, that's my destination, that's where I want to be, but I gotta get out this hell hole first
Yeah. Can you email it to me rather than me watching it on a damn little phone? <laugh>
Yeah, just if you had that much coming in, how would you wanna give back?
So I'm, My mind isn't there, so I don't even know to be honest, but it sounds possible
But it sounds like I, you're a good guy
Money's really just a tool to get the things that we want
I had my other business running, but yeah, I actually never received the book
So I mean that's what I wanna do
I'll follow up with you and we'll go from there
That's an amazing vision I have to say
Yeah, so Donny, the reason I'm reaching out is I'm actually on Brian's student success team here
It'll be nice to make it a family trip
Cause I think I may have a super solid idea of how we can help you
It put a massive smile on my face here and that's really what I love about this job
You guys are secure and you guys have money in the bank to be able to handle whatever life throws at you
Yeah, I don't really be having to hold when I'm out here on this road
That is Yeah, plenty of sense actually
Okay. I'll make it happen for you, Daniel. Well, it was great getting to know you.
So in case, I don't know cause I almost sent people's number
So I'm excited to see her call goes man
Right. Appreciate it. Have a good one.
And then I'll send over a calendar invite to your email
I should be able to call. Yeah, I should be able to. Yeah, I just have a appointment at 1230 to one 30, so
This is rental properties, basically. Not owner, not properties he owns or a mix
For sure man. For sure. How'd the workout go?
I just wanna make sure that it is something that you find valuable
Why are you asking all this?
So I guess, is that what you're asking about or what exactly are you asking about?
So I kind of just put it on hold
<inaudible>. So you got the book?
I work at a insurance insurance company
I also want to go to Dubai
Yeah. What's the health spa called?
Exactly. So get your first 10 up and running. You
Or if you're like, Hey, I like that video, that was cool man
I need a little, gotta get my mind together on it
Yeah, that's definitely a challenge that we need to be solved to
I guess I'm a little hesitant to start when I'm not settled down as
Understood. I totally get you there. Okay, cool. And you're working quite a bit right now?
I know the bank account keeps growing, but then I deplete it pretty quickly whenever I add new units
Okay, cool. Do you want me to break down how that call would go if I can find some availability in their calendar?
Right. Yeah. Not while you're driving.
We would do our business together. We would do more investment properties, flipping houses per strategy, et cetera.
I know it may not work out, but why not? You know what I mean?
Wow, I don't mind helping out
And any questions you have that you come with a call with that and the executive consultant be able to answer those
He is a huge golfer as well as an avid
I'm not gonna give you any personal information
I'm limited here, but they have much more time to do calls
If you have a 500 credit versus a 700 strategy for Airbnb, it's gonna be way different
I generally think this can be the thing for you, man
Well I know when getting homes or apartments maybe renting, a lot of times you're gonna look at your credit score and your income
Not that I don't enjoy what I do, but being able to have a little more free time for other things
Hey, yeah, I'm sorry I'm walking through the store here
If I don't have a lot of good loads I can't give myself over a thousand
F O X W O R T H, Mississippi,
Actually hold. Okay, I'm back to you. Sorry about that.
So we actually aren't able to book the calendars like this past about 48 hours in advance
And it's quite possible <affirmative> that I'll kind of move that direction
Okay. Yeah, I totally understand it. And how would you think you're gonna feel when you finally have that your debt free paid off?
But like I said, I'm definitely not opposed to the arbitrage
Maybe you could one of those little tracker things, you know, can catch it to your app and then track
Okay. Awesome. Great. And so is your best email right now doval under space 1276 yahoo.com?
Hey, this is Thomas with B Formula
You send me a voicemail again, he might be in a meeting or something.
All right, looks like it went through
They work directly with Brian Page, they do some outside consulting with some big bucks
What would change? For me personally, I probably would move my mom and my sister locally. They don't live in town and
I know that was one of the reasons I stopped doing it <affirmative>
Yeah. Cause hopefully with it being kind of a loop,
Yeah, how about you? Are you in the crypto?
I did not know where to start and yeah, that's what
What I've learned is that I know that nothing is free
It provides you some great information, some good stuff about what's working well in the Airbnb
Well man, you sound like a really cool guy
Cause I'm not a rental arbitrage guy
Stratton needs to figure out what's best for you
The latest I can book is Saturday
Monthly net income from your whole Airbnb portfolio?
Yeah. Is that something like you've thought about
Yeah, I got it. Okay. So hi man. What would be a word to describe how you'd feel a 10 k a month? Man,
Those are the ones that typically have the most success
So 5 30, 6 30 we could shoot for something like that
So just to make sure that Mr
Fantastic. Well question for you. You remember spending about a thousand dollars with us on the BNB formula course a while back?
I'm not gonna be able to run my credit right now cause I'm working with a credit resource to fix my credit. <affirmative>.
I'm not even sure that that would be the best fit for you to be completely honest
This isn't a sales call, is it? Because I don't really don't need another sales call.
Yeah, for sure. And do you own any of the properties or you doing the rental arbitrage?
I think he was from some area in California that I actually go to all the time
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. You obviously, Yep. So
Maybe it's a combination of all three between Airbnb notes least the purchase options
Let's say it's you can do bigger, better property
So Lorenzo, I just wanna make sure I got a good grasp on where you're at
I guess I kind of forgot about that strategy and maybe someday I was thinking about coming back possibly
And so because of that, I won't be able to focus in specifically on this coming Monday
So let's see, I'm at work for the next four days
So that's kind of where you're looking at Airbnb. It's like it's way less,
And we actually talking about this just this morning of people who were in the same sort of experience that you had
In terms of my schedule? I think I'm good to go
But our guy that I was just referring to, he had about 30 units
Noah oi, Friday 6:00 PM Eastern time
Yeah, I'm just trying to make,
Dozens of people are actually swimming up in that seven figure mark
It's in San Gabriel Hilton, the second floor of the Hilton
Let's see, I got most of my tied up in crypto and let just say maybe about five grand.
And by the way, with that video, people are always messaging me like, Yo, I found that super valuable, super grateful
So I wouldn't be able to book out for Friday
Is that a big obstacle for you in terms of getting into Airbnb and starting to have success?
Look at my calendar real quick.
So if I go to doctor's office, I can't actually close a six grand deal
No. No. Well I mean I have someone come in and clean my house personally, but
If not, then you still have a game plan to run with Airbnb, would you be opposed to that?
Gotcha. Then how long have you been working at Milwaukee Tools for?
We're gonna get you everything that you need
So Thursday, December 30th, 1:00 PM Central Time.
I mean, I guess it would be, it'd be more than that if I was the smartest person in the world. But
Looks like we have a four or four 30 this afternoon. You could do.
To go full time on the clothing brand or to go full time on the Airbnb. Oh, on the brand.
So I mean, is there a checkpoint along the way in terms of monthly income that would really change some things for you?
I know I feel like you
And nothing that we couldn't help anyone screwed around
And so you're totally fine there
So we basically decided to put it off to lobster, summer and just learn a lot right now
Just for me to learn about it
So all of them are personally done six or even seven figures with their Airbnb businesses
I can tell you that for sure
So Christine, what's the full name on the card?
Well the reason for the call today is we saw you hadn't had a chance to speak with anyone from our team yet
Yeah, I mean definitely more than 40 but yep.
I'm not gonna sit here and lie to anyone and tell them, Hey, you know what, the money is great and there's no issue
Four 30. That's okay. Okay. Yeah, I gotta, Sorry, thought you said four 30 there, so you're in for four 30 with Mr. William Butler today.
Do you want me to fill it out now?
I mean, what about somebody, some dumb college kids come and break all the stuff
Well right now I just have my pension at the moment. Then with the flip of the home, I left my job September 1st.
Long term we you're looking to get to with that
Awesome. Hey, do you remember spending about a thousand dollars with us on that b and B formula course a while back?
It's just me right now. My husband is into something else, so it's just gonna be me. Okay.
Of course, Tara. Anything we can do to help, and feel free to reach out to me if you need anything. Okay,
We are 45 minutes from Sacramento.
So if I know that you're gonna call it around that time, then I'll pick it up
We won't, won't be charging your card
I mean they're light years ahead of me
So about 10 years until you're at the place, you have two or 50 properties and enough cash flow to create those programs
Yeah, so we work with three different funding sources
Yeah, I meant to call you back
I, but I do believe that this formula, what I've invested in here, I do believe it's the answer
I just don't know how much time I can commit it again to pay for it
Everything sent me back to his dollar 99 audiobook
How you think you'd help your family out?
I could give you at the last average, the last two years was 10 to 15 around there
But I have three of them, little broke best friends,
Okay, gotcha. And then not saying we have to use it at all, but do you have credit cards?
Yeah, then we'll just do like that then
If we were making that much man, we'd build badass portfolio
And I'd still have money left over
If I take the time to email that to you, we watch it
You need the time, you need your dietician to really to be on public as a priority
I don't know what to say
All right. And then the best email, is it the doc Jerry Murphy gmail?
As long as I can get it on my calendar
And so right now I don't have any but I am getting my parents into it
I just wanna make sure that we're committed on that end
Cause this is something I do want to enter into
Wait, why don't you send me an email and just gimme your email and so I can do that
Right now? Well I'm in this company called Ames Tools
Is there an insurance on that or? Yep,
Good. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Well yeah.
Yeah, for the most part. All makes sense.
Joe, would you be opposed? Okay
Got you now. I'm in Washington DC so it was Eastern. Okay,
So I don't find a way to increase the income through or another method with entertainers, stocks, or some other kind of business
Well, the reason I'm calling you is I'm the manager on our student success team here for Brian
You'd like to retire as soon as possible
That's why I say if I could create another five to 10 on an Airbnb model, that would be great.
All right, brother. Good talking to you Daniel. We'll talk to you soon, okay?
And then just I'm gonna put you with Mr
But that's my first MO motivation and then myself, my own inspirations, whatever the house, the no payment, the Rose Royce
So do you remember that book at, Did you read through that by chance?
All right. Yeah, that sounds good. 11:00 AM Wednesday. Yeah, <affirmative>.
We get about one property every 45 days, and the average property that's about $2,000 a month
So I'm super excited this conversation goes for you
We're trying in a kind of catch up role
Gotcha. Okay. Well I mean it sounds like exactly the information you're looking for. I have some of that. I also
In order to protect our executive consultant's time, especially Mr
Most powerful uptick in bookings and revenue than ever
The number on my tax return last year is 50. The one this year is gonna be,
Cool. Now I gotta look at their calendar first, see what we can do. But how does that sound?
Well if we do it here it'll just be myself. Cause I'm just here by myself, so myself,
And then the last name is A N S T E i me
What, Yeah, I've already been gone for, I don't know, four maybe.
Yeah, of course I have a list
If you can get a hold of, tell me more
So when it comes out to it, I spent about eight grand
So I mean you gotta have money to make money
So I have a basic understanding of how Airbnb works in the entire process
So that takes a long time
And then, so Lorenzo, there's two more things for wrap up cause I gotta hop off here in a few minutes
And you see that's extremely difficult
Yeah, I am. And I'm not doing too good on a couple of them. Oh
Okay. So what did it drop to
Like just my iPhone being it does that with multiple numbers. Call me.
There's gotta be a lot of sparkles and bes, <laugh>
5:00 PM Yeah, check calendar here.
<affirmative>, that's good money. That's good. Yeah, you can't beat that
Hey, it's Cooper with Bmb Formula. Brian Page's team. How you doing?
So I guess you could say something around there
6 million from his Airbnb portfolio loan
Okay. Above seven 20. Cool. And then also a ballpark here, but what is your current annual income?
Ideal monthly income, Like profit or just a monthly income, revenue,
It's just getting that first property
Who's, what certificates you might need and the proper precautions and measurements that you know need in order to just start your first business
I would say I'm safe with say 10 to 15,000.
And how long has it been like this?
Okay, gotcha. So would it make sense to have her on the call as well to get any of her questions answered?
Yeah. Yeah. It's not really, definitely, yeah, it's just owning three trucks, so it's not really a big <affirmative> company.
Oh absolutely. She's already proud of me.
Awesome. So the first question is, what is your credit score
I don't know what kind of openings you have
Cause I'm gonna be out, I'm go come home
Oh, sounds like you're getting a little bit hesitant.
John Stratton, you know, guys are talking
So we actually don't book these appointments out past like 48 hours in advance
And then in the second email you will see a link in the top that says add to Google calendar
It really kind of separates them from, and they regularly charge about a thousand dollars just for a single 60 minute consulting session
And that will be good to go
Well not let 'em back home sometimes a month back on weekends.
I hope you have an awesome rest of your day and you'll be hearing from me shortly
Hey Douglas, this is Thomas with b B Formula from Brian Page's team
And so the average a home as far as a rental is about $1,200 a month
Do, would either one of those work,
Yeah, so that's my name's Thomas and I sent that over to you. So Mr. Rob Smith is who you'll be calling with tomorrow.
Typically started working just about two to three hours per week on Airbnb
And I don't wanna do it anymore
I haven't really thought about what my job title is. I mean you could say a developer. I'm also on Noel Furniture. I mean
I would like to but again mean you've got me at a good time because I am in between cases <laugh> shall we say
From what I know of it's pretty open but she works from home during the day.
Okay, sounds good. What time zone are you in?
Not just experiences of what I've saying
Yeah. It completely, yeah, for me it's a starting point. If it's something that profitable, really, I mean, it's something I would want to expand.
Okay, we'll get you in with Mr
I paid for coaching, I think <laugh>, Oh my god
Yeah. Yeah, it's been a while.
Do you have your calendar set out for tomorrow? Do you know what your day looks like tomorrow
Okay. So that was about 35. 35 40 K a year.
Tomorrow we won't be, but Tuesday my latest appointment is a five 30 or a seven o'clock central time
I guess we'll call it how I was raised
Next would be 6:00 PM 7:00 PM which the can't, I'm in Mountain Time
All right, one second. I'm driving right now so that's why I'm making trying.
I know if I was you, I would feel the exact same way
That would be something that I would do along with still keeping my regular 95
Awesome. Let's make it happen. Take it easy, Christine.
But yeah, originally, yeah, it's just the plan changes
So you'd have some extra time, You'd have plenty of extra time
But it's still, even though I make good money, I don't have any time
I mean barring if there's an emergency or what, I don't see anything but no, no, we're still this oil and gas business
So right now what do you do for work?
How many Airbnb properties would you have a year from now?
So yeah, so it looks like we actually may have spoke to you for 30, 45 seconds or something like that before
4 5 45 5 5 45 Tuesday. Yeah, I can make that work.
And then their goal really at the end of the day is to serve as the skip button for you
That's what they're on staff to do
No, I haven't the ones, so we went to Maui and then Honolulu.
So right now most of my funds is tied up
I've told people that the same
So for you, getting to 10 to 20 is really more about being able to leave your current job
Let's see, do you have your calendar up as well?
No a month about 14 or 15 or something like that.
And honestly I love, I get to
Can you wait a second? Hold on. Can you just shoot me an email now so I know I'm getting your emails? Okay.
No, I'd go with my wife. Take my wife.
You know what I mean? You understand
But don't, I'm not willing to pull out of what I'm doing right now because that's making me money
And so that's my main focus
<laugh>? Well that's a good thing. Hey,
That's why cuz I don't know, this world's very temporary and it's not worth just chasing a bag your whole life
So I don't really know at
At least that's what I'm getting from you
No, we're talking about doing Airbnb specifically rental arbitrage where you don't have to own the properties.
Actually this is my second week here and so I'm getting into Airbnbs now
<affirmative>. So would you be able to spend more time with them at home if you, you're making enough from Airbnb?
I signed up with Airbnb, I'm registered with Airbnb
Because if you're more successful than our company's more successful and then it brings in more students just like you
All right. Yep. Bye-bye. Anything. Bye.
And then when leasing properties, it should be listing on Airbnb
I've got 1130 that I can do for them
Sounds like there, especially with speed
So it'd be nice to replace get a five grand a month from your Airbnb units.
And obviously if that's the case, well then that requires a higher level of investment, does cost money there
So you'll, you'll also have my number if you need to text me for whatever reason
<affirmative>, how much do you have in crypto? Right now
Cause we do have a policy to charge a hundred dollars cancellation or reschedule fee for these appointments
How much would you need to make to get to that position?
Yeah. And is Matt gonna call me or do I call him or how does that work?
I swear I will be there man. I never missed appointments.
Well, I'm actually, I work with Brian and I'm his customer success manager and so I wanted to reach out and see how you were doing.
Well, I was just looking to diversify my income.
Well our yearly income, Is that what you mean? Yeah, it's about after all everything, all the taxes are all taken out and everything
The reason I'm calling don't, not here to sell you anything
So time and the flow of things let me know if it's long term or not
Could you go ahead and just, we'll set an alarm for that time on Thursday just so you're reminded
I know something crazy comes up, you send me a text and I'll make sure you're good to go
Okay. I'll send you a calendar invite over here as well then. So also we Yeah, go ahead.
So you'll see a hundred dollars charge and then again, that'll be fully refunded after your call,
And is your best phone number for the executive consultant to call you on Mr
If you got to 10 K a month, you wouldn't just stop there
But getting it started is the issue
The last four months it's been like a thousand
Try to help people do what we can.
I never want to hear the word FedEx again
We do it over the phone
Okay. Well awesome. Are you still running air, Are you still running that Airbnb?
And I'm quite sure that probably still be the same with Airbnb, but it'll be a little different
Hundreds of people making six figures, multiple six figures at the Airbnb
So when you did invest in the course cuz people don't invest a thousand, $2,000 for nothing
So let me ask you this because today is good
Brian is a multi seven and eight figure Airbnb and real estate entrepreneur
But yeah, I was already in looking to get out within four years, maybe
It's just not just one area
Good, good, good. Well I'm glad to hear that. I'm glad to hear that. Yeah.
How about 12 Eastern on Monday?
She's 60 now, so she's looking at five more years.
Well what do you think you would do with that type of income? What would change for you personally?
That's definitely the way, a way to go.
We can do Wednesday. How does five or 6:00 PM work?
And we, I'll say honestly, Wednesday is gonna be a better option
I didn't know it was gonna be this year now or never
And then she said that I can rent out and start doing Airbnb through there
So right now at my job I'm making 83 a year
Scan the game. Yeah, I totally get that.
It might be a little more than a thousand
I mean I can buy more real estate right now
Well matter of fact, he's not even eight anymore
I'm just saying I haven't put in the time to actually do it for that
Yeah. Then I will be there. Right.
Oh yeah, sorry. So I'd like to go through the program again. This is available.
So that's just kind of the first step, the stepping stone
Lance's gonna prep for this to give you the best information and he's gonna be giving you his undivided attention
Okay, so about a year ago I bought the course
I mean, yeah, I set the call.
You'd love to clear 20 K a month
So unfortunately I'm not able to book these out past about 48 hours
So do you mind helping me fill that out real quick? Just three questions
Yeah, it sounds like you just wanna be able to travel some more frequently
Dude, I love it. I love, man, how old are you right now?
So if you were making 160 a year, what would you do
Well listen Chris, you're honestly in a phenomenal spot to actually get started with this
I sure will. Thank you so much.
So much. All right. You're welcome, Fumi. Take it easy.
And if there's anybody out there willing to help me, I will take it immediately
Yeah. Why not saying it's gonna happen? Why
Well, the reason I'm calling, and don't worry, I'm not here to sell you anything
Let's see about 20 seconds here as get confirmation on that
So the second one is totally vacant
The things they look at when you're going to get leases on properties?
<affirmative> Correct. Anywhere. Gotcha. Exactly. Vacation.
To be completely honest, I wouldn't know how they would, I mean it's possibly do some sort of credit towards it
Would it be too much to ask for you to watch that before your call with Mr
So the first question here is, do you know what your credit score is?
But if I worked 50 weeks and then I started
He, he's the one that wrote the book and they regularly are getting paid just two grand for a single hour of consulting
Say just for you and then gross income, so before taxes.
And I think that should be just about everything
And so really the first action step is getting up on that call and getting in what you need from Mr
And 12 months down the road, he's got 14 properties now and he told my manager last month that he netted $25,000 in February
Well, okay, well then I'm glad I called you here because we can definitely help you out
It's like I'm a supervisor but I'm on the back end
So from person to person, I won't have to worry about that
We're quoting another flip that we are, we just picked up last week
So I think my last year would be, what year is it? 21? Yeah, I think it would be like 24, 25 around that
Would your primary goal then with a Airbnb to replace your income so that you could leave that job?
Oh, well was there anything in particular that held you back from getting started? Like timing wasn't right, didn't have enough money, anything like that?
You can offer the spot to somebody else
Hey, this is Thomas with b B Formula. Brian Page asked me to give you a call to see how you're doing on your Airbnb journey.
You have some stock but it's not doing good at all.
I'll go ahead and email that to you right after this
Okay, What do you think? Yeah, what do
And I'd hate for you to ever have to pay that
You got scheduled with Miss Catherine Funk
No, yeah, that's great. Income <laugh>, this is property.
I hate the annual because it's just so, it's so wide ranged, you know what I mean? <affirmative> and our contract changes all the time.
You were supposed to get your money back for something
Gimme a second. I gotta go somewhere else cause people keep trying to talk to you. Give me a second.
Cuz these executive consultants, these are serious dudes, they don't mess around
Actually, let me check here then. So are you still in Eastern time right now,
You'll be able to watch that before you speak with him tomorrow afternoon
<affirmative> is your credit score over 620?
I think 3:00 PM would probably be good
Right. Cause I'm sure you guys are working a lot. You guys both work full time?
Oh C for information in the event this is not in your calendar, please use the calendar links provided below to add
Yeah, makes sense. Just to need a little more clarity on the path to get there.
I mean, just to give you some context, and I know you don't have 14 properties, but you do have seven
So you can or call me back or whatever, let me know
Make sure you can take full advantage of the call obviously Jo, some questions, Jo, some notes
So yeah, things life is moving that way right now, but yeah, I can Wednesday I prefer the morning hours
I can definitely get you an ebook copy of it
Could you watch that before your call today?
You'll be home, You and your wife will be ready to go at that point?
He didn't have any properties or anything like that
I just had 24 points hit me and figure out what that's about
When was the last time you tried logging in?
I think it's kinda a silly policy too
So just use fully aware is, would there be anyone else involved in your Airbnb business, like a spouse or a partner or anything?
You decide the next six months, I'm not going to give up
So what are you thinking there?
And so I wanted to reach out and check in with you to see how you're doing with the course
So you're gonna be with Don Stratton
We do help with financing to a certain degree
Yeah, so typically the way that it works, I just have a certain structure that I follow and it's just policy
And if not, then you'd be good to go and confirm for that time
It would've to be either on a weekend or weekend
All good. You too, dude. Thanks. Appreciate it. I'll talk soon,
Right now. Central time zone. Gotcha.
The calls now? I've been doing that for Jesus, nine years. I have my own practice.
Okay, sounds great, Cooper, I appreciate it.
That's what it seemed like to me
Yeah, that honestly might be worse than the fucking dry heat <laugh>.
I know I'm talking a lot, man, I apologize
I wasn't able to talk for that long just to say, Hey, call me back later. <laugh>.
That's what it's really gonna boil down to
Smith needs to figure out what's best for you
Just by doing the right things, the right steps
That's where my drives come from basically
With Brian Page's team. Do you remember purchasing Brian's book a while back on starting an Airbnb business without actually owning the property?
Joe needs to figure out what's best for you
Oh, well I'm looking at my accounts right now actually, since I had it all pulled up.
Okay. And r a bria lowe one gmail.com. Is that the best email for you?
Maybe go through there take some notes if you can
Do you not want to wanna travel around much?
Of course that's not the long term goal
Awesome person all around and great energy as well
So I'm done for the night but any time 5:00 AM all the way up until 6:00 PM my hours of being available
Yeah, 4:00 PM or 5:00 PM
Which date are you in? After
Gotcha. <laugh>. Yeah. Yeah, that's okay. Yeah,
Got it. So I don't have to worry about that.
It's close to the airport. It's like, I think 10 minutes from the airport South Atlanta over there by Canopy Drive.
I see an opportunity in helping you, like I said
Well, a question for you. How do you feel like growing your Airbnb business will help you get there?
So that would be the main
I've gotten the green light to hook people up when I see fit
Saturday would you could do a Oh, awesome
Paying off debt and investing in rental property? So that's probably to start anyways, that is what I would do.
And I'm just gonna double check the schedule here really quick
Okay, so let me pull up the calendar
I don't have me, I'm picky as far as where I want to do it
There's nothing for anybody I already got
There's a super low inventory of rental houses here and most of them <laugh> are already doing that <laugh>, but Right
Okay. And I mean, you mentioned your husband quitting his job as well. Why would you wanna basically do that for him?
So what if I could pull some strings on my end? <laugh>, exactly right
I'm sure I don't have any Airbnbs just yet
That's all that Miss Katherine Funk needs to figure out what's best for you
He's an absolute killer with his Airbnb business
But say you were kind of smarter than the rest of the pack, you did better, didn't have any limitations
Okay. And is your credit score pretty low right now?
And then I have money trade. Yeah.
Can also be also conference then via phone call. We do threeway calls with couples or business partners all the time.
I don't know if Airbnb would work full time around
And we only did it off my, only off my income
I made close to 70,000 I think.
You wouldn't just stop at 4,000
So I wanted to see how you're doing with the course so far
Oh yeah, for sure. Cool. Like hands down?
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, so you're dealing with a nasty long term runner right now, tenant?
So that being said I'm also in the process of getting applying for some business funding
Oh, just saying take care now.
I haven't actually been able to get started yet
Cause like I said, I am not asking this company that mean your company to approve me for anything
Three kids. Wow. How old are they?
And until then, man, have an awesome day
Oh, I'm doing well. And yourself?
Give about 20 seconds here and I'll make sure that we can get you confirmed in for that time.
You too. Appreciate the call. Thanks a lot.
So we do have a hundred dollars fee for reschedules cancellations or just flat out notes to protect their time
Okay, that's all good. I know stuff happens. So what got you interested in Airbnb in the first place?
Unfortunately, I'm not with the mother, so it was survival
5,000. Awesome. Great. So you're at about a six 10 credit score and 95,000 income.
So even though the rates of rent are growing up, the average nightly rate for Airbnb hosts is growing super quickly
So worst case scenario, I'll probably be able to talk in the car
Well, I mean ultimately 10, 15,000 a month
Okay. Yep. 2500, 2600 a month in expenses.
All right, give me one moment. Yeah, it says booking is confirmed. Should I hit get started now?
If I take the time to email that to you, will you watch it prior?
Yeah. All right, so let's do that. So 10:00 AM Friday.
Would you be opposed to that?
You're an early man. Early riser. I man. Yeah.
So he is not owning any properties and he's already got 14 properties under his belt here and he's netting about $25,000 a month
Now obviously if that's the case, that would require a higher level of investment
We currently have half a million in cash.
Okay. These guys are literally the best in the business.
We'll we'll get you locked in here
And just one less important thing before your call, I'm gonna send you over a really important video
And at this point you probably shouldn't
Wow. Do you feel like you kind of feel that right now?
That's what that means for me
I can reach out to Diane on our support team and have her send you out your login to your email
Okay, lemme go back. Yeah, I got a Oh, okay. Yeah it said yes, maybe a no, I just clicked. Yes. Yeah.
And it's one last thing before your call
I've stuck in be, even in my long term, I've been stuck in between
Yeah, well hear me out on this cuz I think this could really help you out here on our team
Yeah. What we can do because this is sort of a unique situation I'm thinking of ways we could do this and do you have Venmo?
But as far as everything that I told, I mean because like said you're getting hundreds of calls a day
Oh, okay. Let's see. I'm at a two then. No
Well, I mean, just to give you a little bit of context, we've actually got one guy off the top of my head
How about we do 3:00 PM actually, so we'll be 3:00 PM Eastern time tomorrow you're gonna be driving through Kentucky
I really don't remember the book receiving it
Well, I pick them up at seven 30, takes me 20 minutes to get home and then another 20 to get settled down
Okay. That's in, so that's in cash. And then not saying we have to use it, but do you have anything in stocks or crypto?
Okay. And Robert, what's your last name?
Okay. So the shifting work locations, tell me, can you explain a little bit what you mean by that?
If everything else goes to shit at least, cause I have other stuff going on as well
Well 10 K a month, that's a great place to start
Okay. I mean, are you working full time right now or is it just your husband working as well?
Okay, so the only last thing before your is Mr
2:00 PM And do you have about 40 to 45 minutes? So two to 2 45?
So we're kind of gone to debt
All right. Yeah, you have a great rest of your day.
I want to maybe do this for you
For sure, man. And so in order to be a millionaire, you mean like cash millionaire in the bank after taxes, everything like that?
Where are you calling from today?
Great. And how are things going?
It's like usually I do things and I don't know
I'd love to get in on it
But it's not like fucking trying to make 10 K a month extra on top of everything I'm doing
So I would just continue to do that
No, I think that would be fine. 7:00 PM tonight.
I had all them systems set up
Let me break it down a few a little bit. Options,
Sometimes I talk to 20 year olds and they're like, I'm making zero money and I have zero credit
So my partner, she makes 15,000 a month she's been working for 10 years
People, all the governors are taking the mandates, mass mandates off
Okay, gotcha. No worries. Well, why don't we do this? Did you get my text?
So at least have something to possibly start with
So could you commit to watching that before your call?
I'm glad we got the connect
Okay. I got it. <affirmative>. So I don't even
If I take the time to email that to you right now, will you watch it?
So I mean, if you got to seven to eight grand a month and you were like, Cool, that's what we need
Yeah, that's fine. We can do 2:00 PM
So I've been using these really expensive lock state resort lock stuff and man that stuff just fails on me left
Okay. And then how much available capital or cash do you have on hand to put into deposits, on properties, purchase furniture, that sort of thing?
This year. This year we did one 20 before we, well we well over 180 this year on average. Last year we did like 180.
You actually have a list that you wrote out or you put it on your phone?
Then members wise with the new law, that would potentially suffice. Yeah.
<affirmative>. Yeah. Are they in public school right now?
Would you mind helping me fill it out?
I'm 50 now, so 51 I guess I turned so I'm not gonna live forever
And then it will be over the phone like a phone call
And we found that most people, me, people just weren't able to have success, but that's because they just didn't get started
But after 12 o'clock and after as full on the 14th and the 15th is totally booked
Dude, you sound like an awesome guy
So is there any possible chance you can set aside 60 minutes tomorrow or Wednesday?
They can help you see how you can get from where you are now to ultimately where you want to be
It's gonna be more than eight hours. Okay. The core videos, there's also other stuff that comes along with that. Deborah, what
5 million and then you're renting it for a hundred bucks a day
Yeah. So wait, so how much free time do you have now?
I'm like, dang, you've been business long than I've been a live man
So shifting in other words, not right at my house
Taking that next step with doing it
We are actually in Scottsdale, Arizona. So literally right by Phoenix.
I don't think I can handle that much because <laugh>, when you're younger, you can handle way more
Stratton know manually that you guys will be talking later today
If I take the time to email that to you, will you watch it?
I don't know if she's gonna be able to respond tonight
I'm sure we could do that and Okay
Oi he's an awesome consultant here
So say you did do that and you were able to grow that number even higher
Well, I mean really that's what the call is about
Do me about one second here. That loaded up. All right. And then the card, does that have a middle initial on it?
And then there's more testimonials and good reviews and then we can in turn help more people
City. Hang on just a second. I'll be right back. Okay. Yeah. Hi there. Are you there?
That's really what I want to do.
That's a beautiful part about this business man,
So once you have the money and the reinvestments, the residuals, what's the ultimate goal mean? What do you really want?
Up where you guys located out of?
The whole thing is just learning how to get started.
It's d S A t Montana gmail.com.
I'm reappearing my credit right now so I got it out
I don't really know how soon that I can get that
Yes, I do want to make enough money to actually focus on needs <affirmative>
And this is my direct line, John, so this is how you can reach me
Essentially what you can do there is that would be how you make money on Airbnb without owning any properties
Okay, sounds like a plan then. So I will hear from, Okay, so maybe lemme see.
I would say man, probably a three
Is this your personal number or is this something that or is this an office number?
Gotcha. So you're about a six 40 credit score and a 30 K year income.
And my biggest problem is kind of time at this point
Well, the reason I'm calling is I'm actually the manager of our student success team
Hey John, this is Cooper with B and B Formula. I'm on Brian Page's team. How's everything
Oh, close to eight. 1800 to 2000 a month.
We just, well look, I mean we'll have to get Jeffrey cuz you're kind of newer to the whole Airbnb business
Dwayne, well go ahead and get your booked in for Ms
So I think I probably only pull it off one time
Hey Charise, this is Thomas. I'm just giving you a call back. We spoke briefly, I think yesterday about some Airbnb stuff.
Well, I mean, hey man, congratulations
She'd probably be at work and me and my girlfriend, we do stuff together so she could also be a candidate
One of our what's what's the Apex holdings? What's that?
Oh but wait, you know what man, hold on
I'm not trying to sell you anything
Okay. And is that where your home is or is that where you're working right now?
Negative? Maybe you'd have time to meet some people.
Best case scenario, I can be back in my home office and we can sit down
I definitely save more cause that's something that I should have been doing as I come along
And really that's like I won't tell someone me, if I truly believe someone won't succeed, then I'm gonna call 'em out on it
Okay, cool. You kinda want me to break down how that call would go if I can find some availability in their calendar.
So I'm just on a way to create financial freedom and I understand that Airbnb is one of those ways
Oh, I'm literally stumped right now about where this could be
This is your time and this is your time to make things happen
But as at least if you're free at the same time, I've got a 1230 and a one o'clock during the day tomorrow
So tell her that I have a fully paid for manufactured home in Blythe, California
Are you currently working a job right now?
So I have a good credit score
And the other one was a 7 17, 7 10, something like that
Right. I know exactly who you're talking about now. <laugh>. Yeah, I was just like,
So with that said, you could be totally frank with me
Boom. All right, let's do it. Torrance, are you in central time or Eastern
Okay. Gotcha. What else? Do you have any sort of impact that you feel like you want to have or something you wanna leave behind
Ka fuck know that you guys are watching that video and that's it, man
Yeah, you're welcome. All right man, so keep in touch.
Okay. How much longer? No sense. I just <laugh>, I got kiddo back here.
My girl would be like, You gotta get up babe, you gotta get up
Go ahead and pull up per calendar here
You should see two emails and one of the emails at the top will be a ability to press
I got a little bit of power here
That. So what do you think? I'm
We got most people doing it that way
I mean peace and happiness and freedom. Be able to things I wanna do.
I think it's eight 10 <affirmative>.
So let me just get some clarity cause I understand what you're saying
Yeah, I think I just had it ran. Is that 7 99?
And that being said, please be sure to do whatever you need to do
So it really depends on your specific vision and your goal
And it's not a small wallet either
Do you know what your credit score is?
And what we've found is that those students on average are working other jobs or have other businesses
See it's 3,700. I don't know the average, see between C 30 and 700.
Since then, it had the most powerful resurgence it ever had power
It's a super important pre-call video, just so I know it's been a while since the book
I'll definitely reach back to you
<affirmative> seven to 10,000 a month
And so I manage the sales team as well as installers
I know. Look, look, that was my own was my own plan. So other people thinking like that. All right.
BBB formula. You remember spending a thousand dollars on Brian's course while back?
You're like, what? And yeah, Brian's like, Well dude, if you're bored, come aboard
Yeah, yeah. I don't mean right now. I think rest of the day say sometime later on this week or when they do have some availability.
Understood. Well question for you mean, how do you feel that having an Airbnb business would allow you those things?
<laugh> <laugh>. Did it come through Mark does that?
And so that's kind of what it's like for you, just the fast path to get started and get you in the right direction
Could you just watch that before we call on Saturday, just so you're best prepared?
And I'm gonna send over a calendar invite. Email really quick. You real quick it.
And we'll lock you in for 4:11 AM on Tuesday and I'll send you a calendar invite
We have on file from when you bought the book just to protect Brian's executive consultants time and Brian
Well, I'd like a house at Wash Park, which is about two and a half million.
I'll go here and put that in the notes
Right. So this is for tomorrow for two o'clock?
He actually has an opening tomorrow at three 30, which is awesome cuz he's our top executive consultant
I've bought courses before things come up in our life and so I'll reach out to our head of customer support
Have a great birthday weekend and I'll talk to you later
Let's say I may wanna host people having meetings
And it sounds like now is the time, it's kind of start making some things happen
Not a problem. Okay, awesome. Sounds good. Uo. The only other
So it sounds like generational wealth is a priority for you and we talked a lot about that yesterday just a little bit
My personal would be like 120.
And if you have any questions, hit me up throughout the week and we'll go from there
I work a full time job.
And then when you're not there, you got it on Airbnb
I haven't actually looked at it much. Sorry about that.
Okay, so about one second, I'll get you locked in for that time.
Share it? That's what I like to hear. So yeah, if you want.
You're gonna be figuring out how much rent costs, you're gonna figure out how much occupancy you can get
What's going on brother? It's Cooper. We spoke yesterday on Brian Page's team. How you doing? You were in the middle of a drive through.
I mean I'd reinvest a lot of it and just keep it going and create more generational wealth
Okay, awesome. Well let's just get you booked in for that then.
It is you're working. Yeah. What's that? That's understandable. So we actually have some times open tomorrow. We could do a 10:00 AM central time tomorrow,
And so I'll send you a text probably about an hour before your call just to be like, hey it's about an hour away
I will go ahead and try to run that here. I take a second.
How set for alarm at 2 45 or 3 30, 3 30,
And then we just can't have any blank space on the calendar
So <affirmative>, those are the two biggest things
Typically they're gonna look at a few different things from the property owner perspective to determine if they give you the lease
So they're not wasting a bunch of time getting into it and making a bunch of mistakes and whatever
And is your best email lia s jackson gmail
It'll bring you up to speed
I mean, you're in Iowa? Yeah, we can do, We'll look at Pacific time. Are you free? Do you know if you're free Saturday?
But your location is very solid
And yeah, I would hate for this to stop you from getting help for this
But of course I'm gonna be willing to expand and we'll set new goals as we go
Do you want me to break down how that would go real quick? If I can find an open spot on their calendar?
I mean you can get there with two property, my man, the average property using Airbnb arbitrage and that's about $2,000 a month
Okay, awesome. You wanna do a 10:00 AM central time?
<laugh>. Right. Gotcha. These guys work directly with Brian Page, so it wouldn't actually be Brian but one of our executive consultants.
I've had some issues. I had my credit card stolen in the fall and it took me a long time to repair that.
That. You're welcome Greg. Awesome. I look forward to hearing. I go. Take it easy, Greg. Thank
From a property owner perspective they typically ask for that
Yeah. No worries dude. A hundred percent. It's all good. You're looking to grow. You're looking to grow. That's what you're looking to do.
Now I've got it up and running, but now I'm having GPU issues
50 60. Okay. And is that self-employment income then?
I'm gonna be honest with you
And how much do you guys need to be able to do that?
I'm trying to raise the average student success rate, so if we can get you ripping, we will
So do you wanna pull up your calendar for tomorrow and just see what you have available and are you in Mountain time?
And that's the problem is how do you quit a full time job and real estate as an agent bringing in almost 200
<affirmative> for sure. And where do they live?
I just wanted to be fully transparent with you and really make sure you guys could make it
I mean at this point we've been able to help a lot of people who actually have gotten started
Would you bring anyone with you?
Yeah, I mean that's amazing that impact you could have even on your family just from a few properties
<affirmative>, and you feel like you've been in the mud, so to speak, for how long
But for something like this, literally just about anybody can do it
Greg, I'll make sure we have Dan send that stuff over to you after the call
And he's a really nice guy
Two jobs, Yeah, Working two jobs. I was thinking about the third one, but not right now.
It's do whatever it takes to create something
If you can a hundred percent, that would be awesome
Thomas, you said three properties a year from now because the credit is kind of the big problem
What about that memorizing theran and raising really good children. What about that is important to you?
This wanna be fully transparent with you and make sure you can make it
Gotcha. Yeah, not the but more so thinking outside the box, given what you have available, what you do right now,
I have people asking me now
I'm gonna see if I can pull a few strings for you and get you on a call with one of our consultants
Let me just do this here
And how many years does she have before she's looking to retire from her full-time work?
So I just wanna make sure that you guys could definitely be there for that
I'll say it and then spell it jet bev
I wanna be able to do more for them
I'm doing wonderful. Jerry, you remember spending a thousand dollars on Brian's course while back on the Airbnb business?
Do you mind telling me what kind of numbers you're putting up? I mean, talk to me about the occupancy that you've got
Yeah I'd say if you're probably looking at for your first property, you'd probably be looking at six. They said what's that?
I think I could be successful with this
Not that they own it, but rental, I mean all over the country
And I think that once I do finish that and do pull that off, then I think it's get much easier from there
Maybe set up some Airbnbs, different places around the world that we like to go to <affirmative>
If I could get you a full hour long consulting session with one of these guys for free
Can we do a little later? Only because I've got dispatching in the morning. I've got a transportation
So it looks like our availability's booked up for the rest of today
Now. Yeah, that's kind of what we found.
Now the last thing before your call, Mr
So we have different time zones here on the calendar
So obviously we know this is an important call for you
But I'm a manager of a building I live at, right? I just have two new bedrooms available right now
And maybe that was my fault
Cause that's the first thing that we think about is, okay, I don't have money
And for a lot of these guys, they regularly get paid $2,000 just for single hour of consulting
So I've not yet started I'm still saving up and getting ready to start
Just do the bird method essentially
And so that's kind of what you could expect
So <affirmative>, that makes it a lot easier and that's what I'm looking for with other income
Currently between the two of us together
Okay, gotcha. Yeah, that makes sense. I
I've also been reading that you can rent places and then being beat them
Okay. And so does that why you're interested in Brian's stuff? You
But no guarantee that if I'll pick up my phone just in case I'm on a call or something
She's working about 30 to 35 typically.
Just to give you some context just before you go into your call, you're asking about people buy the properties, they lease the properties
Well is it okay to do it later? Yeah, yeah
Now that I'm curious cuz usually people don't invest a thousand, 2000 bucks unless there's a specific result they're looking to get to
But yeah, if I could make fucking K a month off of it, that would be pretty nice
How much available capital do you have at the present moment to put into leases or mortgages on these properties?
I don't have anything to do with it. I don't know where I could find it or what to do with it.
20 to 30,000 extra a month? Personally, I'd definitely work a little bit less at the hospital <laugh>, but
So I, once you guys have all this money and investments for you guys, what's the ultimate goal? What are you guys really after?
It's just a range where I would personally feel more comfortable with
You're actually, okay, I thought you were saying an hour per week
Why do you think you haven't gone out to get more than just the one
I was doing software consulting before my career was in software development and Covid just shut that down and that was about 75,000 a year
So I just wanna be fully transparent with you, make sure you make it
I just have some really good information
Yes, I work a lot right now
But with this whole covid thing, I don't wanna go anywhere
So we actually don't actually not allowed to book these more than about 48 hours, 36 hours in advance
But they just had a little bit more going on for 'em with location, the highway hospital wineries
Sounds like you kind of resonate with that.
All right. Well go ahead and lock it in for you on Tuesday and I'll send everything over to that Gmail account we have. Okay,
That's so cool. So on a scale from one to 10, how much would we have the words of awesome independence at 150 K a year?
And that's my goal for the next couple years is to get some streams of passive income going
It's pretty, Yeah, I mean once you see it you're gonna know it
And I'd hate for you'd ever have to pay that
How I could realistically get started
A baby can kind put some stuff on hold
So 10 Airbnbs and really you wanna do that to be able to help set your friends up for success
<affirmative>. Gotcha. So about 700, 7 10. And you said you've been working at the Mercedes plant for about nine years,
This is what you gotta do
I pretty much just follow him there
We had big projects on the commercial side and stuff
So I guess the resource that I would need unless you have more questions, did you wanna ask me more questions?
Let me pull it up real quick.
Will you be able to watch that before the three o'clock today?
And I'll shoot you a calendar invite right after this
Great. I got it. Is this a video call or is this a regular telephone call?
<laugh>. All right, perfect, man. I appreciate it.
Yeah. Okay. It's nice. Something you're Options. Options.
What's that ideal income on a monthly basis that you're hoping to get to with an Airbnb business?
Well now it's been a while
I mean usually people don't invest into a little book on a business opportunity unless there's a specific result they're looking to get to
So it sounds like you're already pretty ready to go, you're doing some research for you
Smith does prefer to have anybody who gets on his calendar to watch that video before his call
And you'll, you want me to text you after the meeting, right? Which is the eighth? After the eighth, right? Yes
Glad we could could hash something out
I think right now the only hesitation is not having that deployable cash because it's tied up in other assets at the moment
Oh, I'm going in the right
Exactly. A hundred k for sure. For
Maybe you first add to calendar, then get on a calendar just so it's confirmed on both sides and it will be confirmed in the system.
I can do whatever I want pretty much. Okay, cool. Yeah,
Okay. Yes sir. Awesome. And you're in Eastern time, right?
And so heck, even if you got 23 out of 30 nights, which is decent, it's not the entire month but it's decent
Nows all they care about the health
Okay. I had to confirm a purchase. Okay,
Probably 1:00 PM Hey, can you gimme just a second? I'm at Chick-fil-A. I'm about order <laugh>.
So my thing is I have a good client that have stable locations for a while, but when covid hit it kinda went crazy
What would you do as an
Wow. I think I set up <inaudible> in she in Phoenix or I don't think she's in Phoenix. Yeah, she's down south of
I mean don't have as much as some other people might, but a hundred thousand a good benchmark for some of that
Lemme pull up the calendars here
We're a lot more equipped to actually getting new results than I am
Okay, awesome. Would you like me to break down how that call would go if I can find some availability in their calendar?
Do you remember purchasing Brian Page's book called the b and B formula while back, teaches you how to become financially independent on Airbnb?
He's a doctor and works part-time in hops between New York, Utah, and Iowa
So, okay, so you're booked in with Mr
Yeah, a hundred percent man. A hundred percent.
That is number one goal. It just hasn't happened yet, so unfortunately. Yeah. Yep. It hasn't happened yet, so yeah. Correct.
Now obviously if that is the case, well then that does require a higher level of investment
So you can pretty much make it work anywhere
It sounds like you're still in the beginning stages
So that's the piece cuz I was wanting to possibly, possibly do the whole rental arbitrage thing
I'm working tomorrow but I work night shift. I'm a nurse and I'm actually going to work right now, so <laugh>.
It's kind of the main things I do for my job
So it seems like the big challenge is, okay, I feel like I can be successful with this
The person you've reached is using a screening service from Google and will get a transcript of this call
Wow. So you're just having to support yourself completely right now it sounds like.
But if I take the time to email that to you, will you be able to watch it before your call tomorrow?
Sounds like you're driving right now
So I'm allowed to hook you up with some pre resources to make that happen
My wife is upset about that
If I take the time to email that to you, will you watch it?
Let me reverse this card so I can put it in park
So for you, man, I mean, what's kind of like the ideal monthly income you'd be hoping to get to with Airbnb?
30, so calendar invite and the video as soon as we get off the phone here and got you locked in
Just takes about 20 to 30 minutes
Yeah, and we'll send you a video to watch
Huh? Go put it in then
Yeah, I'd definitely be willing to talk, but we gonna definitely have to set a time <affirmative> and a date. Cause like I said,
Yeah, I already came in earlier today and I signed earlier and I, yeah, I had to come back
Are you a snowbird lifestyle yourself now or just looking to do a yet
Yeah, I'd have to go through it again and to refresh my memory on everything
Well, Thomas, I appreciate your call and I like the fact that you're gonna fill in all the <laugh> fill in from day one
I'm sorry, can you repeat that last part one more time? My son was slamming cupboards and I could not hear you
I just want a house, a decent car
And that's kind of like where the other headquarters is in the company
Last name page, p a g e
Looks like it went through successfully
How much would you be able to travel then?
Trying to gather some time that I can actually put some good time to it.
And I mean we send sold tons and tons of copies of that book, about 50,000 actually
In this video allows us to serve you better and it will both save us a lot of time
It's probably 60 at work and at appointments and then another 20 at home on a computer
If you wanna go ahead and just
Typically that's what we do here is that that's something we can do just to help out
I'll make sure to confirm that in his side as well and just in terms of the calendar invites
Yep. Okay. Minimum, yeah, you can get there with one property. Do you know about the rental arbitrage model?
And to see kind of the game plan you guys come up with, the takeaways you have, it just gets me excited, man
Oh Daniel, here's what I do for you
Another 20 grand to pay off my truck
And are those coaches really good? They know they are certified coaches and they have proven records of what they're doing
<laugh> Live a comfortable lifestyle in my retirement.
So you go out and he said, How do you deal with, I guess, the people you're leasing with, property owners?
So let me wrap it up and just show you how we could potentially get out here
Yeah, she's awesome and she's gonna blow your mind
I mean these guys are literally the best in the business
My music, my traveling, my helping my family, my work
That's like a low number and I'm hoping to exceed that and go beyond that. But that's the initial goal.
And that's hard for me because I'm not a irresponsible type of guy
You too. Thanks. Thanks for calling. Bye-bye.
Catherine Funk needs to figure out what's best for you
And so that's kind of why I'm reaching out today because I found that if I could just give you that little push
Well no, I know my son likes camping
I don't wanna get my time wasted with somebody that really, I won't get
No, I mean, I'm pretty good for my word, but let me see here. Is that, what day is that? Let me see. Wednesday, is
I'm not a big fan of charities
Gotcha. Okay. And Jason is your best email jason dot night 2000 gmail.com?
Do you want me to share it?
What about a perfect world where you were 10 times smarter than everybody else? What would that goal be?
Yeah, I'm really sorry man, I can't do it. I can't do it then.
I think both of them, I don't know what they do
And then freeing up myself a little bit more so that I can take more vacations and stress a little less
But I mean this is, dream here for a second
Okay. I have a five o'clock on Saturday.
Or today. I would have to double check. I would have to double check with her, but yeah, tomorrow or tomorrow would be better.
But it would be nice to eventually get a couple properties once my schedule frees up a little bit
I've had friends and also associates that have been over there <affirmative> and everybody says the same thing
I could probably do that. Do little income by if I can pull a little money together. Yeah.
Yeah. Cause I had went to next week schedule Wednesday at 11 o'clock. Get them in at nine. Nine, 10 back 11.
Lemme tell you, occupancy rate right now is, I don't know, maybe are we freaking pricing lower than most people or what
All right, brother. Good talking to you today. Sorry we caught you on a rough date, but tomorrow's gonna be better, right?
And you can do that with multiple properties
Okay. What question for you, how do you feel that having an Airbnb business would help you get that?
Only reason I ask is the video is super important just in order for you to have a great call
Oh yeah, I'll definitely, Any pointers and ways of how we can better, I'm all for that Cooper. Yeah.
That Tomorrow the 17th, one 30, tomorrow
Okay, awesome. Got this here. And then the email I've got on file is sam spt logistics.com. Is that the best email for you?
I cannot at four 30, I have my son's gymnastics class. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesdays are the best time for me.
Cuz actually, I thought after I about the course I was like, okay, they're gonna, I didn't expect you to follow up like that
And so I know how it can be
Here here's another, Well here's one more issue I'm having
Well, I mean the ultimate goal is to have something set up
And I have an idea of how we can help you
So I mean really it'd just be probably laying in that first deal to get that spark that's like, oh this could actually work
I gotta just get a little more proactive instead of reactive
A lot. I don't just, I don't know. I don't love to share this
Time. Central time. All right. And you're working the rest of today, right?
All right. What time zone are you in
They work directly with Brian paid himself and a lot of times they get paid over the consulting up to $2,000 an hour
Yeah, just get rest, spend time with family a little bit
Could you watch that before your call with him?
What would be the prerequisites for that?
I'll tell you what man, you sound like you can make, if you get resource, you can make it really fast
I mean Airbnb, that's still real estate
So you don't see for any reason why you wouldn't be able to make the 10 30 tomorrow, right?
I'll be completely frank with you
No there is in any industry you're in
Well, you know what actually got me excited was the ability to start with that, to do that without having to buy a house.
Personally, I'm looking for that financial freedom to not have to work so much
Yep, I do. I got two of 'em going now. I met one of them getting 'em ready for some new guests.
Wanna double check Paul, cause we do have a order for rescheduled cancellations or note codes
Typically it is a thousand dollars time slot
Only reason I answered was cuz you called three times for me to even know it was you.
And that is all the need
Yeah, I got So one of
One time. Yeah, it looks like Thursday. One o'clock Thursday, one o'clock is open.
How did that feel? Six figures of debt? Geez.
I'd be like, that'd 300 k plus a month in cash flow
And so it's one thing I'm required to do is fill out this little form for executive consultant
Okay, awesome. Want me to break down how that call would go if I can find some availability in their calendar?
Yeah, I think it does. I'm not sure I've, I've heard it before. I'm not sure what it connected, but know I've heard that name before.
Last part. Yeah, well, once that house is done and it's up and running, then I can start looking at other properties.
It might be a few additional expenses, maybe like $2,800 a month in profit. You'd looking at that food. Property
So it looks like we got you booked in with Mr
Lemme tell you right now. Gimme a second. It says my credit score is 6 21.
But if the situation was right I would consider getting back working with you guys again
And people that <laugh> that's why I turned
So if you stop just cuz we have businesses sometimes the full owner investor role, sometimes they're still partially operating it
I'm just kind of using that money and just growing it
Not all of the hustle and bustle like that
So one last thing I'm required to do is just fill out a little form so that Mr
First deal. The amount of effort that's gonna be involved in getting a deal really
What do you mean by that?
Not at this time, but I am talking to my goman about working with me a little bit more
Yeah man, the sky's the limit
I'm gonna email that to you right now
I'm talking about world peace stuff. You don't wanna talk about that? Yeah you
Louis, which is where I plan on or within an hour, St
Honestly, to be completely honest, it was the idea, not the money
Here's kind of my thought process
That would be amazing, man. And so right now you said right now you're in college?
Nope, just a phone call. He'll give you a call at three Central time.
I want to enhance my relationship with my family too. Enhance it. I think we I gotta do better with that.
Okay. And you said your annual income was 21 K, Is that from all sources?
So that's a whole different type of situation
My boss knows somebody that's a friend of the family, this, all that kind of stuff
And I'm shocked you can hear that
Make time to pick up that call. I get it. Trust me.
So I did get through the course,
Texas about an hour behind you out here in Arizona?
I'll also text you for my direct work line so it's kind of like a group number
Full time job. Gotcha. And what do you do?
I'd have to be able to go talk to him in person and right now I'm stuck on lockdown
Cause that Brian does it about $1,200 a month cash flow
They'll probably send you a text
And it just kind of helps me figure out what direction I can point you in
Yeah, so I have on my cell phone, I have the phone number 2 5 4 1 7 3 6 3 4
The only thing that we have there, that policy is just to protect the calendar slots of these executive consultants
Yes, I could do that. 11 works.
I'll send you a calendar invite as well
How many hours do you think we spend a week? Both of us
And he, he's in a year, maybe a little over a year into his business, he already has 14 properties
I think my wifi kicked it, but I'm really glad we could get connected back again this morning
It's just a number that I came up with right now
And if it's an investment property, the bank's gonna require 20% down
That's been the issue I've been had
I love the way you put it there as well
But he's on track to net 2 million in his second year, and he is already got 80 properties
Yeah. Oh, I got it. I know about between five to 10,000 if we're counting stocks and crypto as well.
So what are trying to are you one of the coach coaches for this program?
But see I live in Chicago when it's kind of a bumpy road when it comes to Airbnb and Chicago
Those are my opportunities to do what I wanna do
Yeah, around 10,000 would be great.
Okay. And she working full time too. Is she working on the b b business?
Lemme just pull the calendars here
All right, man. Of course. You have a great night.
Whatever I do, money will follow me
Yeah. Okay. And so you're Atlantis, that's Eastern time zone
No, it's pretty hard. See, Wednesday.
What about Friday? Yeah, no, Friday will be a good day for us
And you're in Pacific time zone? Yeah
So it looks, let's say you're good, you're confirmed it with Mr
Sounds good, Emmanuel, I'll go ahead and lock this in here
He can be totally focused on it
Yep, yep. I just got it.
Okay. I did a little reboot of my system. Hopefully it goes better. Okay. If not, I can try to relocate.
You want me to share it?
And then I know you got the four month old and so we'll just wrap this up in two more minutes
Okay. And then I'll also text you tomorrow just in case something didn't go through on the text side. I'll text you as well tomorrow.
And the reason why we have that in place is we really just wanna protect our executive consultants time
So could you run through that again really quick?
Yeah. So I hundred percent believe you or not. Well
I'm gonna check out this website
I'm sorry, your connection's a little bit bad right now. I can't really pick up on everything you're saying. Can you repeat what you said?
Okay, Gustavo got you locked in here
How's it going? This is Cooper Bmb formula. Brian Page's team. How's everything
Pretty wide open for central time
When your students do great, then the company does great as well
Of course A 10, yes. As long as I got a time and a date, I can definitely make that happen.
Let's all live 1,050 years old.
After summer. So August, September we should be in Florida. Should be all life happens <laugh>. Okay. Bye bye September. We should be there.
So I was quite disappointed in that
So really the biggest thing is doest even work right now
I can reach out to her and then if that happens to work tomorrow, then we'll do that
And I'm getting a late start <affirmative> cause I had a bad life
But dude, for you, I'll make it happen. I'll make it happen man.
So I just wanted to be fully transparent with you and make sure that you could make it
I haven't talked to many people with 800 score and <laugh>
To be honest, you know what I'm saying, I want to learn
A hundred percent clarity, No, for sure not.
Just thinking here for a second
Okay. So if you had an extra $5,000 a month, you'd go visit your kids.
Any big what's it called? Not called a show or something, but y'all have a meeting, some
Four 30. That's okay, I'll change it
And yeah, that's where I'm at right now, <laugh>
Work a few weeks a month and basically be able to travel a week for month without, ideally without having to sacrifice your lifestyle
And now a part of I'm gonna put, and he's our top guy as a part of his consulting process
And so it's probably just a matter of how to access that in the course and whatnot
Okay. And would they call my cell phone then?
Yeah, I got one in the morning, one in the evening
I never actually get to get started because actually I had some financial stuff out was to take care of
The money's good but you're still strapped
Like a mother boarding computer, right?
I'm not in New York City
Cause they know every single property they get is closer to that number
To me, just a steady cash flow would be good
I would definitely would be pouring back into the city
I definitely don't wanna do that
So I don't have the team right now, but it is being built
Yeah, this should be fine. 3:00 PM should be fine.
But then other than that, I mean it sounds like you also wanna donate
Can watch it. You can watch it.
What would you do if you were bringing that in? Were 5k, month in,
And so are you driving right now?
Would there be anyone else involved in your Airbnb business? Like a spouse or a partner or would it just be you?
But if we are there, there's no charge at eight 30 to a phone conference at eight 30
I mean for you, what would you do with an extra 20 to $30,000 a month coming in? What would change for you personally?
It's just not, doesn't allow me to book that far in advance
Yeah, yeah, just put me on hold. Give him a shoot for tomorrow. Which time zone are you in real quick?
Oh, I mean, honestly, to start something, I'm looking at about 3, 4, 5 or 6,000 at least to start early.
At first it would just be me that we were not like boom, shocker, you're retired your incomes drop a lot
I'd probably take that and reinvest it to make it 25 a month
And if someone misses, it's kind of hard to reschedule
I'm gonna email that to you after this just at some point between now and Monday
Oh, okay. I think I just cut out for a second. So just to confirm, for the occupation, construction and security,
It was stopped for two years
11:00 AM Saturday? No, that'd be fine.
I'm actually allowed to hook you up with some free resources to make that happen happened
Yeah. Seven 30 to eight 30.
And we've got other sources of income, We have rental income and stuff like that
All right, Alex, it's great talking to you. Good to meet you and have a great rest of your week and weekend.
You're gonna be able to learn a lot from him
All right, cool. You sure? You sure? A hundred percent. One 30 Tuesday you're good to go for that time.
I do see a serious opportunity in helping you
But I wanna make sure that you can get what you need, man, to really start seeing success with this
We have about 10 grand right now.
They work directly with Brian Page himself
But I guess starting off I'd like to be a little bit close the property to be a little bit closer
Places where people come to visit a lot
So what I can do is I'll actually reach out to our support team and just go ahead and send you out a hard copy
Were you doing long term rentals in there?
I will send it to Chubster 43 <laugh>, lock it in for you, Ryan
They're doing about two hours a week of work
But then we have our own property so we thought we don't really wanna do arbitrage right yet
That's why we would be interested
Do you know of a time that would be a good time for me to give you a call back on
So it's just a job just to pay Gotcha
Then pretty much every other piece of context I need in order to get you results
Well I will, give me one second here
And a lot of people use their free time for different things
So really there's gonna lay out exactly what needs to happen in order for you to get results
They've always wanted a second home but they're like, I don't wanna be tied down to one place
She's a superstar now as a part of Mrs
And I know you said you're running into work so you probably have to go really quick just so I can get some context
So from person to person I won't have to worry about that, right?
That's true for everything in life.
So it's super low barrier entry
When I say uncomfortably I just be literally trying to make sure I control my spending habits cause the shop online shop at that
Well, I try to pride myself on keeping an open mind to everything and yeah, I'm at a 10, I listen, I'll listen.
Okay. Let's see. Yeah, I'm here. Let me just pull that up really quick. What be better for you,
And so yeah, I have cash on hand
But Well, let me pull something up
Cool. Well, Greg, what time zone are you in?
I don't have a job right now.
I mean, there's tons of great opportunities and the real estate market's obviously booming right now
Not much. Okay. I don't have much of life,
And so could you help me fill out some of the information for him?
He's gonna be able to take care of ya
What's kind of that ideal monthly income that you'd be hoping to get to with an Airbnb business?
Okay, cool. So what time zone are you in
I would use a ton of my money toward traveling because the world's so big
That's one of the things that just makes my job fun, is to hear how things go and I would just make my day
I do. And the ultimate goal behind that is what more free time to be able to leave
That's how I felt when I was doing it
And right now we're not in a position where she could just quit
Yeah. Would you like me to break down how the call would go if I can find some availability?
So that being said, I am looking to liquidate pretty soon within the next, I'd say within the next three months or so
So here's kind of my thought process on this
Storage units car washes, all these are hours from me
I know some people are saying 5,000 to 7,000, some are saying nine to 10,000, so nine to 12,000
Is that something you'd wanna take advantage of?
So those are the timelines you're looking at with Airbnb dude like a hundred percent
So I will be able to help them out financially
So you wanna put it under your digital calendar as well? You can do that or it have an official invitation in there.
Awesome. Sounds good. And just to confirm, again, a hundred percent 10:00 AM central time Wednesday works for you?
So I've got, right, I've got a 7, 8 30 and a 10:00 AM tomorrow, and then my latest is a two if needed
Consulting, right? There's consultants for meetings and everything like that
Yeah, I, I'll go, I'll send you a page of the testimonials just so you can see it
It's like a 12 minute video
So I bought one four and a half years ago and I bought the other one in January.
In order to protect our executive consultants' time, we require a hundred dollars fully refundable deposit and we refund it
Airbnb? So I never got that book.
My full-time job is only 36 hours a week, so that's three days a week only
So I'll email that to you right after this
You guys, Yeah, some of those can be pesky
Contact No, based on what we're talking about, sounds like,
So if I send that video over to you, email and text, could you watch that before your call with him?
I can try to Airbnb rentals, rent places I rent like Brian talked about
So it looks like we could do cause we have consultants who are promote as well
Gotcha. So you want to increase that capital you can invest in more proper.
And I'm gonna get you on the call with Catherine so that you can get the device and you can just implement straight away
Would either of those work for you?
I'm gonna send you a text right now with your email on the way
So I actually do have a lot on my back right now, weighing me down
I do see some serious opportunity in helping you out
We got to open up this conversation man
That's all the context that Mr
For tomorrow? Yeah, I should be pretty.
I've got a two 30 and a 4:00 PM
It's a very large 4,000 square foot house and getting a lot of bookings and having a lot of success
Yes, this Friday. Or we could do possibly a Thursday, Wednesday. I just mentioned Friday cuz that's what I heard you say earlier.
So I, I've got some things going on Facebook, Amazon Walmart websites and whatnot
I mean we have people everywhere
No, there's nothing about, There's not nothing about the executive consultation
Mean right now we've have literally hundreds of multi six figure Airbnb beers, and we even have dozens of seven figure Airbnb beers
Well I'll lock it in for you
Well Manny, here's what I'm gonna do for you, man
He's been up to Northeast or through Canada to Yellowstone through the west coast and he's just embraced it
You're gonna send both videos, the 30 minute and then the one, another one.
We do have some people who do that
<laugh> most of the time. That's the alarm clock. The alarm clock.
So it starts with two kids and now you're talking grandkids
We have some down here in Arizona
No, I wouldn't be opposed to it
Little real estate gurus that are sucking the money out of me
So this is what you're putting on W two is reporting the irs, that sort of thing
And the main customers are solar companies
There's not someone there walking you through it or really helping you through it
They work directly with Brian Page himself
I have no problem with that
That's actually why I'm reaching out to you today
He's got 14 properties, 12 months into his journey and he's making $25,000 a month
Okay, gotcha. And the drive behind four to five K is financial freedom, right?
I mean, I guess I'd just be looking for more ways to invest my money
Well it looks like we're locked in
And yeah, I think that's what I wanna do
So yeah, a hundred percent, dude
No, send it to me. It's something I would like to watch.
So the only thing I have available tomorrow is four o'clock in the afternoon and then I have some more availability on Wednesday
So I was just curious, how's the Airbnb journey going so far?
Okay. Tell me about this, the rental property as it get. Are you like,
Cause we're starting really low, so we're having to keep our money close tight to us
And how much are you profiting Right now
I've got a two 30 start, a three o'clock or a four o'clock central start
That's what I'm trying to push it
But yeah, shoot it to me
Or what about five 30 today when he's in gymnastics I can come home for an hour or something.
And in a lot of cases in just six to 12 months, people were able to completely replace their current income
Oh, Arizona, okay. I've been out there a few times.
Okay. Yeah, feel free to check a calendar or schedule anything. I can hang tight.
Okay. Would your spouse be helping you with this Airbnb business if it was something that you wanted to start or would it just be you?
Yeah, I definitely need to look at, I definitely think I need to look into some pricing strategy
Now I don't know how much to come in and I can put it in
And I haven't bought any of the programs without digging into what I got
But the market was changing and it just was just like no interest
Okay. It's 4 0 6 6 1 4 7 0 9 7 5 0 1 9.
I'm probably looking around a million dollars, and so that takes a hit
And so what would that look like for you? You started producing some more income from Airbnbs
Cause working for somebody will always get somebody else rich than yourself
And so the person who's gonna be calling you, it's gonna be one of our executive consultants
The goal is to, Yeah, cause I wouldn't leave it permanently, but I would go from being full-time to part-time
Yeah. <laugh>. Hey, do you remember spending about a thousand dollars with us on the b and b formula course a while back?
I mean we're not retirement, early retirement we would be taking but we've been working for large companies for a long time
And then C'S going on and some health complications came up, but yeah
I mean, even Elon Musk and Jeff Bes have some checkpoints
Total expert knows everything there is to know, he'll be super helpful for you
So my actual parents used to do this back home in Jamaica where I'm from
I'm about to get into a truck so I can hear you better
Currently? Right now? I think around six 40.
Is there any reason, Can you think of anything that might come up?
Yeah, actually, I mean, I knew about Airbnb
Cool. MJ sadler 14 comcast.net. Is that a good email for you?
Well, sounds good Joe you're good
Okay. That sounds good, man. I'm excited for this call on Friday.
What I'd probably want to do is get a refresher on the book though
So that's actually really good news because you actually may be in a pretty good spot to start getting into Airbnbs now
You could watch it right after this call if you have the time. Just at least before your call with Mr. Rob Smith.
Oh man. But I'm actually 19 as well. Well you
Smartest guy in the entire world. Are we talking monthly or annually?
But even on the high end, you could be even clearing $4,000 a month with those two properties
And then I just wanna double check that I have the right email address on file. So I have your first name, Aja Dak at yahoo.fr?
I don't, my wife set it up with a house that we own
All right. Talk to you later. Yeah,
This dude is legitimately one of the best at our company especially people who are looking to get into Airbnbs in that beginning stages
Yep. Stop and I'll make it work.
I feel like investments are gonna be really where it's at right now and stuff
How much do you need to make?
So I'm still gonna be putting in those hours, but just putting towards something that would generate me more and help others
I'm gonna do this another way
Yeah, so going good but it's not take some work
And one of our goals on the student success team really here is to help people get better results
I can cut the conversation short for you cause I'm sure you're calling to make some kind of a sale
Not to cut you off, but you said you wanted to get to 20 K a month, right? Ideally
10:00 AM I can make that happen tomorrow. 10:00 AM
Well, the reason I'm calling you is I'm actually the manager on our student success team here for Brian
Of course, man. Of course. That's what I'm here to do, man. That's what I'm here to do. What
But yeah, just that extra income stream is what I was interested in
So it looks like we got you scheduled with Mr
Okay, what you finalize in here and it looks like we got you in with Mr
No worries. And do you have any background in real estate? Not that it's needed, just curious.
I mean this is not just, is almost like it's a brand new home
I probably would have about 25 or 30,000 that I could put towards properties.
Yeah. Awesome. So do you go by the ddrick?
Yeah, I remember growing up with my dad, he was military and working a job so he put in a ton of hours too
No, but I mean, I don't know, I feel like that's a good number
Does that ring a bell for you?
I won't be looking to make five grand a month, five grand or more.
Right? Oh my god, it was the worst year I've ever had in my life.
Yeah I shoot but I'm trying to take over the family expenses and stuff, so
Today is not, I've got a few meetings I gotta hit. Tomorrow would be tomorrow or Sunday would be perfect.
And how much per month can you tell me, on average, how much per month are you making right now in passive income?
Okay. SW. And I never asked you what branch you in?
Man? That my goal is to open up more property and just that hands free and being able to scale things out
I went through with Brian and now I'm just bored
I'm doing H V A C
So it looks like we scheduled and he is one of the best in our company right now
There's still gonna be funerals and it's gonna be a halfway point between road trips and all that sort of stuff
Yeah, I would try to do that, yeah.
Yes, I know we have an appointment to go to Wednesday. I think it's in the morning though.
It takes up all of my time
Do you want me to share it?
So were you able to get started with Airbnb or what's going on?
Do you have any idea what you'd be shooting for per month as far as monthly cash flow? Yeah
As a appoint partner? The one, the partner would be my partner
And that zip is 39 4 83.
That's a dream that you're dream and you're making money
So just wanted to be fully transparent with you and make sure that you can make it right
Ready to learn, ready to take notes
Well, I would like to pursue this
Something you're excited for, right? Yeah
Time. Okay. Let's see. Central time. So what's your schedule look like tomorrow? Would you be able to make a 2:00 PM
I'm still young, I'm 27, but I'm not gonna be cutting hair forever
Full time? What do you mean?
No problem speaking with anything else I can do for you.
So I wanna make sure I mess it up here
Stratton know that you're committed to watching the video and you are good to go for noon Central tomorrow
No, I definitely think I'll be I definitely think it would be great for me
Okay. I've got a lot of stuff open so I could do 1231 later, two 30. What would be the safe best?
You kind of run the management of it from there
We lit it and I just opened a new shop as a partner
Yeah, I mean it's having family in kids' drive seems like that that is gonna be an overwhelming drive compelling you to really make this happen.
Yeah. Understood. What does tomorrow look like for you?
And you're in time, so let me pull up the schedule here
And you just click yes and I'll confirm it on our side.
So ballpark range, what's your credit score right now?
I just know <inaudible> to talk to so many people
Cuz where she was at was different from where I was at
But as far as interviews or anything like that, yeah, count me out
Yeah, it was free. You just had to pay shipping. I got te malouf@gmail.com. Is that your email address?
A hundred dollars compared to the 1000, that's a huge range and it's a big old blank space on their calendars
For you bring that up again, it sounds like it could be pretty cool anywhere else
Do you remember that? Yes, yes, yes, yes.
House that I'm in now? I think the last time I checked there might be 50, maybe 50 grand.
<affirmative> biggest now is the credit and the capital
And they can lay out exactly what needs to happen in order for you to get results
That's fair enough. Yeah. Would you get another home or what does that look like for you?
Anti BNB thing, <laugh> and so
I mean it is what it is
A couple things that might be a big needle move for you
Oh yeah. What for? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>
So <affirmative> obviously you can't expect that, but he's on track to net 2 million in his second year
Another one's like a high six 90, something other one Spirit I think dropped down the lowest, which was a six
I mean, we've actually created hundreds of multi Airbnb beers and dozens of seven figure Airbnb beers
I don't have to rush for rush to do a lot of things and get this stuff done and things like that
Yeah, yeah. Around 70. Yeah. Yeah.
Sure. Yeah, I'll be honest, I'm pretty schedule oriented, so no, I won't miss it.
Wow. And your last name, is that Valenzuela? Mm-hmm.
I'm definitely open suggestions, but let me see what's behind it
I don't. I can't say I do.
But that makes any sense, Understood.
If it's not refunded, I'd be okay
It does not matter to me
And the reason why we have that policy in place is obviously we wanna protect our executive consultant times
I don't know if you know where that's at or not
How much capital do I need? Y'all just tell me.
Okay, thanks so much. Appreciate it. Take care.
Well, yeah, somebody that's minded. It's awesome to do that. So actually my nephew is from born and raised up there in Cason.
Well, to be honest, it would be just strictly being able to invest our money
So I had some hits, but it's still about 7 29
First time we've talked to you about, I don't know if you remember or not
I'm completely focused head down on my active income right now as an individual
I only wanna lock this in for you if you're at a 10
No hundred dollars fee and I'll clear the calendar spot on Matt's thing
To figure outand like how to get an Airbnb
Yeah. Damn man. How would that feel to be the first one?
Honestly, I think I could do that
It's a little discouraging, but I do wanna finish because yes, I did pay for it and this is what I really wanna do
Yeah, if you want you can actually send it to my personal, which will be bart crate gmail.
So, I mean, that's actually why I'm reaching out to you today
So yeah, I will be available at that
That's kinda what you're looking usually to get your first property
And then, so they might bring up obviously how you could work further with some of our coaches
So if you were to go full time, how fast could you scale it?
Hundreds of people are doing multiple six figures with Airbnb
Do you remember? Spending about a thousand dollars on the b and B formula course from Brian Page. Oh, it was a while back.
That's all up to you. I can't make <laugh>, right?
And maybe you can even ask some questions about scaling and buying properties as well
So I'm gonna go ahead and send over a calendar invite to your email
From somebody hand by hand with you on the site
<affirmative> what that? It's C E R C L E I N
Annual income? So I started working about a month ago and I'm bringing about 1200 a month
This thing can be funky sometimes the standard invite
Probably not more than probably 10 Airbnbs.
Legit. So is it just a, okay, I mean, do you think this is not legitimate?
Yeah, that would be really valuable for me. I'd appreciate it for sure.
So Jacob, what is your credit score?
Well cool. How do you feel that having an Airbnb business would help you get some of those things?
No, keep going. Cause then I, I'll need another approximately the same amount to get my right wife retired.
But that's who pays me for my company cause that takes out my taxes and child support and all that stuff
Oh, okay. I like it. I like it. Where would you go first?
Is that the best email address for you?
It'd have to be a big deal for it to be okay for her <affirmative>
Okay, no worries. And then how much available liquid capital do you guys have for new projects, deposits on properties, purchase furniture, that sort of thing?
And then is anyone else involved in your Airbnb business? Just so that I can let him know what's going on
So I want to look into it
Depends on what the kids are doing
And then just go ahead and click on the invitation email
It was supposed to start with, so anyway I money for nothing it looks like, in my opinion at this point
I was gonna do it outta my own house and I just ain't got all the stuff yet
That's true. Okay, so if you look at your calendar for Friday or Saturday, do you have anything that's available for 60 minutes?
Well, I've been working for the government since 2009. I've been in HR since 2014.
Let's see, what is today? It's is this Thursday? Yeah
Don Stratton, who looks like, yes, Mr
So if you're not able to show up to the call focus, you just randomly cancel or no-show or something like that
Yeah, just like a ballpark. Do you think it's over? This is for the lease. Why not? Do you think it's over like 650?
So let's call it, let's just be conservative and say a hundred thousand at one business and 200 to two 50 at the other
Yes, I have a couple credit
Gotcha. So $10,000 a month, that's at the point where you can leave your job man?
That's not I don't know, that's not the way I word on planning on working
You can put some furniture in there, rent it out all month
Seven 90. Okay. And how about your gross annual income, the number you'd put on your tax returns last year?
Sorry Joe, it's not today, it's Friday, November 12th
Well that's one of them, but the best one is actually Jerry, g e r i, Jerry Murphy
Typically now we really try to everything in our power to help
And then another one was how you come up with the money to basically get the furniture and get it all furnished <affirmative>
Have some people who I give a oversight to who I invest in and things like that
I did the same thing. Moved from Seattle to Phoenix back in May of last year.
I love that. Awesome man. Well why did you want to get started with Airbnb? Well, what's the goal
It's the one that teaches you how to start your own Airbnb business without actually owning any of your own property
Yeah, if you just wanna pull up your calendar for tomorrow, take a look at what you got going on so we can make happen.
Good to hear about your success and I'm to connect you with Max
And the two friends that I have, like I said, they're very driven very goal oriented individuals
That's good to hear man. I'm doing wonderful over here. Try and change the world.
And that's really just to protect our executive consultants' time
All right, you too dude. Thank you. Bye.
All right now my credit score is about six 80 something right around there.
I'm actually a manager on the student success team here for Brian
And there's tons of reasons that landlords won't do this themselves
And the results we're seeing with it are just insane
Finally, it sounds like you've been trying things and you're in this place where you really don't wanna be
I am trying to help the world, if you want to be honest
Is that something you'd wanna do?
And so it's just a few questions, Can you help me fill out this form really
This year, since April this year. Before that I was doing like csr stuff for two years. Two, almost two years. So,
Typically it is a thousand dollars time slot
So for you, what's kind of that monthly income from Airbnb that you're looking to get to? What's ideal? Oh
Figure out how they wanna handle it
Monday? Yeah. Okay. I will do some things in the morning but I should be free anything from say 12 o'clock.
Yeah, I can probably make it work here. Yeah. So 9:00 AM for about an hour?
I mean, to be honest, I just made a move
Yes. I mean not, I mean after expenses.
Yeah and you might have just been the audio book or the ebook
How much do you have coming in per month?
You get not having these distractions and pen and paper ready to take some notes
I think if part of it's just the fun and making it, I don't think you necessarily have a
Yes sir. Yes sir. Understood. Where you going to college?
4 1 0 0 3 9 0 1 7 6 6 4 0 9.
So I guess I would look at that as a risk management decision just in terms of how I did that
A, It's like a small paper book. Blue and white.
I mean I'm only 41, I gotta wish to go before retirement, but you know, should always plan
I'm only gonna lock this in if you're outta 10
So I have to actually have the kind of getting back into it
So at least that's what I tell them
I just wrote those notes down
Okay, so that's a D J A D I A K yahoo.fr?
I'll text you, I'll text you want a text you my staff status,
Well, where I would like to go first is Africa.
So renting the properties and then putting those properties on Airbnb
All right, Tyler, I'll send everything your way in his TJ Cohen 99 gmail.com, the best email for you?
It would allow you to do that
Yeah. What would you do? What you're doing 10 K months, you're doing 10 K
Okay, I appreciate it. I'll let Mr. Stratton know you'll be watching that and I look forward to hearing how it goes, Lorenzo.
You have a traditional what you would normally call a nine to five?
I'm just saying for properties or deposits, furniture, that sort of stuff. How much capital are you sitting on right now
All right, well we got you in here
I know there's a lot of sight seeing there
Yeah, I have a nine to five. So this just a side hustle.
Okay, gotcha. You wanna just do a five 30 tomorrow night?
And it looks like we got you scheduled in with Mr
And yeah, I stayed in a couple Airbnbs while I was down there and it was just a blast
Which one of those two, is it more for you?
Oh yeah. Why do you wanna visit here?
It seems like, I mean, this is such a huge world in so many places to visit
I'm a building manager and I have an Airbnb condo as well, but I'd like to expand.
And you knew the average property cash flows in your pocket $1,500 a month
And so I'm really excited to see how our conversation goes
Oh yeah. Thanks for reaching out. Yeah, <affirmative>,
They're lifting their mandates right now
What is it? Like the a hundred dollars deposit is a problem or what's kind of the problem here?
Then 90 days you're at $3,000 a month
Just unfortunately, not necessarily money buys happiness, but it buys opportunity and <affirmative> it can open doors for and makes your lifestyle easier
The average Airbnbs are going for 90 to 110 in my area
If you, Is that a good idea?
Okay. And are you guys still living in the house as well?
Well, I'll let him know that you'll be watching that you on his calendar and that you're good to go
I cut hair about 40 to max 50 hours a week
It's also like you're gonna share with your brother or your mom or something like that
I wanna see data or something
And I don't have kids and I don't have, my siblings are not around so everybody is, Yeah, it's one of those things
My first name is Unique, U N I Q Q U E. My last name is Lamar, l a m a r.
Oh, most definitely. I can definitely see that and understand that.
They work directly with Brian Page itself and they regularly charge a thousand dollars for a single hour of consulting
And yeah, I mean when should I watch it?
Hold on, let me double check. Let in my phone, I have that information.
Could you commit to watching that video before your call later today?
What would that look like a year for you? A year from now?
Right? I mean that's what we do it for in the business of helping people out
Something that I would be very interested in
I'm sorry, I can't, I couldn't hear you. Your phone went out. What'd you say?
And then I'd be free and I would have to go to work <laugh> trying to find my job. That's all
These guys are literally the best in the business, not this
Great man. Jordan, it's Cooper with Bmb formula from Brian Page's team. How you doing?
I'll go ahead and email that to you right after this
I can send you the available times just in case one 30 tomorrow doesn't work
A lot of times people want to set up a property for 10 or 15 out the gate
Decrease your risk and still keep some of the profits
No one ever contacted me about when I was going through the sales pitch and stuff and that your successes and stuff.
You should see a link to add to your Google calendar.
If I could do 50, 50 k monthly.
Okay. And then annual gross income. So before taxes.
So it sounds like you were kind of saw from the other side of things, people going out of town, staying in these places
Is there any reason why you wouldn't be able to make that call tomorrow? Okay
Which card do you have? And I'll tell you whether I have a middle initial on it, usually I don't. So which
For you specifically, what would you do with that time you get back?
I will go ahead and put this in the notes here
And just real quick, we'll crop off
You know what I mean? I know
On a good day? Four, 4:30 PM
Literally I have 6,000 in a saving account right now preparing my move.
And so I'm curious, do you have plans to expand beyond just the rental properties you have?
Well the good thing about here is I hardly even sweat when I'm out here, which is nice.
Yeah. So yeah that should be a good time man. Just before lunch or something. Yeah.
And then I've got marcelle hensley gmail
And you have that in. You're welcome. You're welcome. Do you have that in your calendar? 6:00 PM Eastern on Monday?
Well, we are not prepared for retirement
You're in for 4:00 PM Thursday and I'll also connect you with Michael via text
I listen to podcasts all the time, bigger pockets and all that kind of stuff
We're a lot more equipped at getting you results, getting information than I am
So what got you interested in Airbnb in the first place?
I made a lot of money in 2020
But for Minnesota this time of year, I don't like, it's hard to ask for any more than what we got <laugh>
And you believe that as of right now, they don't truly have everything that they need?
I'm not having a good feeling about it
Unless there's a emergency and you can text me at any time
All right. So it will be 2:00 PM my time on the mountain time here. So 1:00 PM Pacific time?
Well Brenda, I hear a kid in the background so I won't be too much longer here
Is that something you'd want to do?
I'm glad we got to open this up today
Cause they actually work with Brian Page
But right now it's kind of like, okay, well let's see where this go
All right, Marcelle. Well, you have a great rest of your evening and watch out for my emails right after this. Okay?
Yes. I didn't say Tuesday. Yes. Yeah, my family in there. Yeah, I'm available for that.
So those two character traits and really what we see most in the people that do the best within the people that we help
Right? You'll send it later somehow, right?
Now, obviously, if that's the case, well then that does require a higher level of investment
So he has some context and he can best prepare for your call cuz you mentioned earlier about finances
So I don't ever say nothing back, but in my head I don't ever tell 'em nothing negative
Okay. Do you know the limits on those?
Yeah, tomorrow five 30, I have actually have a slot open with our top executive consultant
Honestly, I haven't had that happen to me
Or maybe I didn't know how to take advantage of it
I need to get you a book first
Okay. Is to the number that you texted?
So yeah, I just felt like it was better to do my own thing
It's a black owned business and from the bottom as well
Tell me about the what you was talking, what you was talking about
It's hard to see the light between those thick dark clouds
So do you wanna go to Southeast Asia? Go to Thailand and Bali
The last time I checked it, I believe it was like six 40.
So don't feel bad because most people never ended up having any success with Airbnb
Listen bro, I don't know if you remember or not, but I see that you actually got Brian's book here a while back
I wanna say it's from nine to noon
Well the reason I'm calling is I'm the manager on our student success team here for Brian
So I'm just gonna, I'll put information in here and get you on the calendar of executive for executive your for you
I don't have a 700 credit score.
And then unique, the last thing is Mr
And I, I'd hate for you to ever have to pay that sound
So within 90 days they're making four figures plus of passive income, literally a hundred percent of them
It's a means to do something else cuz we don't take it when we leave here
But we listed both right after Thanksgiving and I was surprised they booked up right in December
That'd be awesome if you able to watch that beforehand
Well usually people don't purchase a book about a business opportunity like this unless there's a specific result they're looking to get to
Okay. Send the video to me.
So yeah, just seeing different views
Like I said, I will be ready to understand the severity of time is money
Okay. Yeah, that's fair. And what kind of impact do you wanna wanna leave behind or do you wanna feel like you have with that?
Hey Chris. It's Cooper with B. B Formula. Brian Page's team. How you doing?
That's definitely where I need to get to. That's what we've been working on. I don't know if you've heard of Guesty or the app.
So let me see here real quick
I've seen people in a lot worse financial situations than you actually be able to turn a dime on this
But the thing is the way, how is, we have a six year old, I don't know how much it's time isn't against us
So it need to be between 150 and 200
What was your question specifically again?
Now I've gotta take a look at their calendars first, but how does all that sound?
Let's see Yes. Monday, December 13th.
Do you know what your credit score is last time you checked?
Hey, it's Cooper with Brian Page's team. How you doing?
Even if it's in stocks or crypto? Right now
You broke up a little. Say again.
I probably have it rented every weekend
So ultimately for you Liddell, I mean, what do you really want?
But at the same time I'm like, it's an expense
You're like, now it's my turn to get some of that
Well, yeah, she never goes anywhere. She's always home.
So now I don't have my mother anymore
So for you man, perfect world, no boundaries, what's the ideal monthly income you'd be hoping to get out of an Airbnb business?
Oh, okay. 60 minutes. Okay. An
I honestly would've expected you to been have said, No, man, I'm totally automated myself out
And for you and your wife, would you guys be doing this together?
So would you mind helping me fill out a few questions for Mr
I was like, Hey, I bought this program three years ago
So there, that's $3,000 a month in almost completely passive income in three months
You won't be driving, you won't be driving or walking the dog or anything like that?
That's really how I feel, man, I'll be honest with you,
I'm sorry dude, I was about to punch myself in the face if I didn't talk to you
Yeah, it's Thomas, the b b formula, Brian Pages team. You remember spending like a thousand dollars on Brian's course while back. Whole Airbnb course
Yeah, I don't know. I guess I don't have a dollar amount on it to say at this point, cause I don't really know.
I'm like, Brian, so I gave you kudos for actually getting me on the phone so you got my attention
Would you be able to watch it before you speak to him on Tuesday morning?
It'll just make sure you have the most effective time while you're with Mr
Is that the best email for
You and your girlfriend can just step away for a bit there
Wow. So four grand and you have seven properties.
Or Tim? Yeah, I go by Thomas. Tom Thomas? Yeah.
Something new, something different. Yeah. You know what I'm saying?
No, we could even do earlier in the day on Monday if you'd like to on Monday if you'd like to.
But like I said, I'm good with multiple avenues
So they get paid back from the Airbnb profits, what they were asking for rent
We said we gotta do it if we're gonna go into this, what I mean, be able to compare contrast or whatnot
I saw you got his book about two months ago about how to create a Airbnb business
Yeah. And what all exactly are they gonna, So you say consultation, what are we gonna cover
Now just know that I'll be in Vinita and I'm not sure what my service is gonna be like
If you search, let's see, actually, here's what I'll do is I'll just send it over, right now's your email address from my email
But if I can get something with Thomas, that'd be awesome
Sure. What was your name one more time?
Yeah. How much you take home every month
Yeah I had some but I didn't. I'm back trying to save again.
And that's the whole reason why I want to do this
Well the reason I'm calling and don't worry, I'm not here to sell you anything
All right. So what do you want to do?
I would a hundred percent believe that you can do this, Sean
Nice man. Yeah, so I'm gonna assume that the bulk of the business that Brian preaches is the arbitrage, is it the leasing?
Let's have some context on where you're at right now
The modules and stuff give to us is pretty easy if you go with it
<laugh>. Yeah. Buck Chick-fil-A for lunch. I want that
I don't wanna set her up for failure because if you pay everything also, I don't want her to be lazy
Yep, yep. Hawaii's great. I'm going to Kauai in a couple months actually.
You can get fully furnished places sometimes if you partner up with a landlord, they'll pay for the F
I appreciate you taking the time of man and looking forward to hearing how it goes for you
Yeah. So you'll be booked in for Friday.
Which time zone are you in?
<laugh>. Right. He was telling my manager that outside of acquiring new properties, he's only working five to six hours per week on the business.
But don't tell me what I would I do with 20,000
That's a good word for it
Butler know you're fully committed to watching that video
Yeah, sure. Got it. Invitation, Yes. Okay. Yeah, I just accepted that.
Hey John, it's Thomas with b and b Formula from Brian Page's team. How are you?
Typically they're booked out a few days in advance, so I don't think anybody is open right now
Right. I am two and a half hours away from my house.
And Callie's, T A L L Y
So it looks like we got you booked in with Mr
I'm like, what? Huh? Oh, well, no, I haven't started my journey yet
Good. I'm doing pretty good. How are you?
It's like how can you do this thing without making another job?
Yes. How long would it take
Oh so that's not like revenue, That's
You're welcome, my ma'am. Bye-bye. Right.
In a way get a way and escape.
How do you feel like that that would help you be able to do all those things and help more people?
So today I may have a little time to just watch it at work to be honest with you
So I just wanna be fully transparent with you and make sure you guys could make it
Thank. Okay sir. Thank you. Bye.
So I don't know if she's more excited about that
Even when they're going through some sort of hardships
I know you're working crazy hours but what time works better for you tomorrow? Would it be 11:00 AM or 2:00 PM central?
I definitely wanna know, like I said, I got my one property
Do you want me to share it?
It is not so great right now because I loan down a lot of money
I'm just old school that way
Oh man, hon, it's so weird you say that because it's really just to live a good life
I bought 11 and then I have another 20 that I'm managing for other people
I do have a credit card.
So it's more just about acquiring some of that information in another section
Potentially in the future though, you looking at a few different things that can determine what you're able to get approved for
The dealership can take care of that bro
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure that was clear
My lowest one was a seven I think it was 7 86 or 96
Okay. Wow. And how long have you been in the business for?
I'm gonna shoot you a text with it and just double confirm that is the right one for you
Next Friday. Yeah. To give me a couple minutes. I can come in <inaudible> Sunday. Yeah, you can call me.
I just think that's wise long term
What is this called? This new part? What is it called? Do you have a name for it?
So one last thing I'm required to do is just fill out a little form so that our executive consultant, Mr
Then they can lay out exactly what would need to happen for you in order for you to get those results
They're scared to do what you are telling them you're gonna do, so they tell you you can't do it either
So say that one last time that I didn't hear you.
So I'm gonna manually put you in and then once we get you scheduled in you'll get sent over invite with a confirmation
But I get the work done when it comes to getting the work done
Unless they want the last two years of banking statements, I'd be able to provide that
Is that something that would be valuable for you?
Okay. Yeah, you just really like those relationships. It's something that's always, Is that something that's always been super important to you?
Cause if not, I could just give this to this opportunity to someone else here
You're on target, you're right on the spot
You could scale within your own local area so it wouldn't have to be all over the place
It. Okay. Yeah. And I can always change
And that's where it starts, man
Would 12:00 PM or 4:00 PM work better for you?
I asked for the b B part
So if I take the time to email that to you after this, would you be able to watch that?
Say that that one more time. I apologize.
We'll go ahead and run that now and then once it goes through, you'll see the a hundred dollars charge
All right, have a good one.
So I think if I back that up, I think those were the two main reasons that I actually stopped doing it
So looks like you're locked in with Mr
I'm gonna send you all the available times so that you can coordinate with what's your partner's name,
Sorry, I'm just declining a call
Taught so, but definitely in pa
I'll go ahead and check to see if we do have some time open Monday, Tuesday
And so I hope you have an awesome day, man, and look forward to hearing how your call goes on Saturday
And then it sounds like maybe you've already gotten four properties, maybe $6,000 a month is just more of a stepping stone
Let's just say I stay in my room but I'm not working
I'm basically success manager for our students
And we will take that money and go and buy at no less than four properties there and all of them will be Airbnbs
My friend I've been reading stuff on stock and my job has been really busy right now at this time of year
Figure out how to do everything before you delegate it out
Mm-hmm <affirmative> make it happen for you man. What time zone are you in?
Four 30? Yeah, I'll be on my way right. Like four. Yeah, four 30 will be great. Great.
And you, you're working with Brian Page and his team, that's the company you work with?
Cool. Yeah, we'll just put seven 80. No worries. And then what's your gross annual income at?
So do you mind helping me fill that out real quick? Just a few questions here
Yes, it's a business, but <affirmative> also thing
And our consultant, Miss Catherine Funk, will be given a new call and just based off all conversation together
Yeah, we could do a 10:00 AM on Monday.
So as long as you show up the to the call, you'll be fully refunded
No, I'm just getting out. You just getting back to normal. But no, I haven't done anything with it.
But my government name is J A V A N and then Jenkins, wherever I call it Java
That is what we're seeing on average right now for our students
You don't work that way and that makes total sense
I was looking, We have Thursdays actually completely booked up for us
You here for on poach? I'm, I'm looking at what I'm talking, I'm looking
And they're always there for the late calls if I need 'em and I can help their, they're all family owned too
Yeah, I mean once, that's not a bad number
There's so many other things that could be done
So go ahead and put blinders on and make your one focus
Like we could set up something for Monday, it's just 60 minutes is absolutely no requirements or anything
I do see a serious opportunity in helping you
So it looks like 6:00 PM on Friday is available with Mr
Hey, Kim. Kim? Hi. Hey, it's Thomas with b and B Formula from Brian Page's team. How are you? Oh,
People are different here and Well,
Okay. Nothing happened. I guess it's, yes, it's highlighted. I guess. I mean selection.
I do have funds though. I have $25,000 in my savings.
I can tell you think things through, I can tell
I got bullied a lot and stuff
So that was just really my thought process behind it
Probably in regards to the financial investment, yes, but not the business.
So we typically recommend about five to $10,000 of capital saved up to get started with this
If I get everything figured out when the air being, well I wanna work 2, 3, 4 hours a day, that should be good. Four hours.
Just different foods, different cultures, different scenery
Okay. Yeah. You want to want her closer by so you can take care of her.
We need really two basic information
The earliest we could do is Wednesday would an 11:00 AM or a 4:00 PM Eastern time and Wednesday work for you?
That's how I've always felt and that's probably what I'm where my goal is
Well dude, the reason I'm calling is I'm actually just on Brian's student success team
I mean I was just trying to get the, get the whole incentive of the program
You can go ahead and save my number
It was the way I came across
I'll go ahead and lock in that time slot for you right now
I think it's just kind of how it's gonna play out
Can you see why my motivation is pretty up? Cuz I had all these things that I, I'm trying to support <laugh>.
The only other thing before the call is Mr
Are you curious? Do you want me to share it?
Temps, just make sure anyone I place on his calendar watches a super important pre-call video beforehand
Okay, I see that. I will click on it.
Okay. And what's your current annual income?
You purchased the book that was about $7 a while back
So I just wanted to make sure I won't have to worry about that, right?
So do you have maybe a 60 minutes to set aside on Saturday for something like this?
Expanding. How many hours a week ideally do you want to be working on this?
And then how do you feel like being at 2000 a month social security is impacting <laugh>? You wanting to get a house?
So yeah, that's kind of where I am with that
<laugh> and yeah, I'd love to know how the call goes as well
Yeah. That's awesome. Pretty dope. I like Gilmore a lot.
Bridger Rogers here at one 30 tomorrow, so we'll get you locked in for that
Well, I understand arbitrage and leverage pretty well cause I've been leveraging other people's money and credit to purchase my last couple properties
Let's modify that email. I'm not really using that email right now, so let me give you a different email.
I'm wonderful. How are you? Doing
And I, I'll give you her name as well,
They can lay out exactly what needs to happen in order for you to get results
Currently? Still in the very beginning stages we bought it
And I come in and say, Oh, I want to put your property under contract
I guess I enjoy giving and seeing people enjoy the windfall our church has been looking to build on or something
This is right now, recently I just used one of the credit cards and I spent like $135 on it
To be financially free? I would like between four and 5,000
He automated himself almost completely out and only does two to three hours a week of work for week
Yeah, we would just be at home.
While that is one approach, it's not the best approach that we've found
So in a perfect world, what do you have a monthly income figure that you're shooting for?
You'll see like accept invitation, you'll say yes, no maybe
And the reason that we have that in policies in place is obviously we wanna protect our executive consultants time
Gonna call you at 11:30 AM Exactly. All right.
Cuz look, we know that a thousand dollars for an hour, not everyone's gonna pay that
It helps you guys out, helps us out as well
That should be just about everything that Mr
All right, Ryan. Cool man. I've got chubster 43 hotmail.com. Is that the best email or do you wanna update that?
Yeah, of course. Take the, Of
Cooper. Cooper feel for you to reach out. I
I think they would totally get it and I really don't think they'd have any problem waiving the fee
Well, I looks like I just sent you over the calendar invite to that Gmail address
Well at least that cash flow, that'd would be a pretty decent cash on that property
I'm saying anything's possible. I didn't expect <laugh> it to happen in the fall.
Not at the moment, but I do have a life insurance policy that's been keeping me afloat.
No kidding. These are for rentals.
And yeah, help out the family a lot more.
But I've been doing lease options
What was, Okay? All right. I appreciate it. What was your name again?
<laugh>. Yeah, sounds like you're getting a little bit of that spring fever. You ready to bust out of the cage?
It's probably in the high sixes.
Yep, everything's good. Got it. Tomorrow, two o'clock, Watch the video first.
But that's a good quality of life and it runs in the background, so without me having to do my work
I'm gonna be out of town Monday through Wednesday, but I can do next Friday if next Friday would work
Well, the reason I'm calling you is I'm the manager on our student success team here for Brian
Mount? Well, I'm in Mountain, but we're going to a delayed vacation for holiday so I'll be in Pacific time zones starting tomorrow.
What about your husband is, does he have any,
Okay, awesome. Would you like me to break down how that call would go if I could find some availability in their calendar?
If I take the time to email that to you, will you watch it?
Obviously with this war going on
Make sure the beast him, how
Okay. Well it's great to hear man, but what time zone are you in?
It's just getting that first few yeses is usually the hardest part
I don't see a stopping point
Nope. Oh wow. Like I said man, I'm just gonna pull something off for you <laugh>.
And you also, were going to depend on a lot of these military graduations for people coming in and staying in Airbnb
Yeah, no, that's great. I can do that. Okay, if you had one later this afternoon, I would do that.
He's like, he's the guy to go to before that
And I'm seeing how Airbnbs are becoming more popular, increasing popularity
So I'm curious for you my man, were you able to actually get any traction with Airbnb or what's going on?
This is one word, so Jordan
Okay. Yeah, ballpark's totally fine. Around 800. Cool. And then also ballpark here, but what's your current annual income?
You'd be able to live a more relaxed, happy life and of course,
How is the affect your life right now?
It's kinda like that monthly ideal income you're hoping to get to with Airbnb
Sure. More motivation, I guess. More incentive for
I know I've actually, I bought courses in the past and haven't really gone through them
Oh, gotcha. Yeah, no worries. What's going on Juan? How you doing?
Okay. I'm much, Yeah, I'm much sure.
Buying the time back, getting more time to do the things that you love
We need at least a hundred thousand dollars a year.
And the thing is I'm trying to not change any of my assets and any of that
I have a busy schedule and I try to squeeze in as much information as I can
Does that name ring a bell at all?
Yeah, like I said, I'm trying to go ahead.
Nice. And then for them, are you a A manager? Do you work in the actual grocery store itself?
I basically, I'm in charge of selling local services as far as listings, 300 listing websites and things like that
Would you use it for vacation? Some people like going on vacations and trips
There's a demanding for the time to really focus and not do something
You didn't really go through that
I enjoy talking to people, the cashier race, the tables, that type of thing
I'll keep that as my backup actually.
And anybody that do it part time and make a fortune, they're lying. I don't care what company is
So I don't, I would say it's probably around 800.
Airbnb you sell the average Airbnb
But they regularly charge about a thousand dollars an hour for their Airbnb consulting
Jackie. Wow. That's super cool. Super cool day you have, that's totally different.
Okay. Just give background. The community that you gave that you grew up in
And your first name was Lawn, is that l o n?
So my only job is to help increase the results of people that purchase the course
I don't want to have to work 80 hours a week to make the amount of money that I wanna make
Yeah, man, I appreciate the call. Definitely kind of pretty random, but I'm glad I got a chance to speak to you
I wasn't sure if that guy was legit or not
No, not the top of my head
I just wanna make sure I didn't butcher this
Thursday I get back to Charlotte at, I land at about 12:30 PM so let's say anytime after one
Before we went to my mom's house
Of course, I have plenty of things to do with 20,000 more dollars
So I've got a two 30 and a four o'clock tomorrow
Oh, awesome. Hey do you remember spending about a thousand dollars with us on the BMB formula course a while back?
My daughter was in California, she moved to Nashville, my son's getting outta college, so he's moving out
Hey Te, it's Cooper at Brian Page's team. How you doing?
Yeah, there's no income currently for my marketing.
Okay. So Gavin, you mentioned you basically wanna hit this 4K month, you can leave your day job. What did you do right now for work?
Cause a lot of times I'm in these hospitals and they don't give good coverage
<affirmative> this is that kind of why you get into Airbnb is to create that basically the secure incomes coming every month
But I know I don't how this world works
And that's j E as in Edward, T T B e v
No, yeah, yeah. This would be three to four minutes tops.
So that's where you wanna go, man
Then it would be much later on
And just to confirm like that 1230 tomorrow, is that a time you a hundred percent will be able to make?
So that's kind of a stopper for anything in this world
We made the purchase and we kind of had some ideas on what we wanted to do with the Airbnb
And just so you know, the way this works, it's super simple in order to protect their time, especially Mr
Eastern. So it's 3, 3 30. Okay.
Yeah, no, no, right. We could definitely make it
Central Time. Okay. Let me see. What does the rest of the day look like for you?
So Kamala, just so you know, like I said earlier where I was calling really, I'm the student success manager here, Fort Bryan
So it looks like we actually do have a few spots open on Monday
Well, and then the last thing they look at is the total verifiable income
That may be how you've been for a while, but I don't believe that's how it will be now
And what would you do with some of the extra money coming in?
I appreciate it Carlos, man, have an awesome day
I know you just sent it to me, but I just wanted to be crystal clear and a hundred percent sure on that
And so we kind of stopped doing that
So right now in terms of getting availability with consultants, we do have some open later next week
I mean, Yeah, and mean if I'm in a meeting I'm always locked in, so
The weather conditions are pretty brutal, so I'm planning to leave
So I'm allowed to hook you up with some pre resources to make that happen
I'm gonna send over a quick 12 minute video that's gonna give some important background information on Brian Page and Airbnb process
And my hope was is if I have any extra money left over, it can help me fund doing Airbnbs
So you know, are confirmed the call with them
Okay. I can do, that'll great.
<affirmative>. And when you say do what you want, what things specifically what'd you end up doing?
But I believe that first property is the, That's the hard part,
I can't tonight either. It would have to be Thursday.
Well, the reason I'm calling you is I'm actually just the manager of our student success team here for Brian
I have to think we should be free.
So all these guys have personally done six and even seven figures with their Airbnb portfolio
Sure. How did you get started with this then?
We're curious that, I mean, where I'm at right now in my mind is if I could just find one thing that actually frigging worked
So reason I'm calling and don't worry, I'm not here to sell you anything
And typically with leases there's a deposit that goes along with it
If I find anybody with against that company of whose name I shall not mention, I will put you in contact with them
We've helped dozens of people make seven figures
I do have it, but moving it into different places with the holidays and such, I have them a little scattered
Yes but I won't be able to do the call today cuz I'm kind of busy but probably tomorrow.
I, if I'm not going out to work, I'm not making money
Yeah, sure. So I mean, you wanna quit your job.
Okay, Understood. And how many properties do you have right now?
Hey, Le Ddrick. Is this the Ddrick?
What, let's do this, let's do this
Yes, I agree with that because that's been the issue for me, especially here in Austin, Texas
Yeah, it was less than 40.
I'm gonna waive the fee for you. Exactly. Yep.
People do it that way as well
I do it. Yeah. Can you hear me? I'm sorry.
Me personally, I mean besides the store in general, we have about 2,500 customers around there, like 24 something
So Friday it is, Friday's the move.
But all, all we ask is a couple things
But honestly, So it sounds like you didn't get started with it but initially I mean what were you interested in?
Tampa's a hot market right now
Well, I am actually on the way to my second job
That's when you get a different side of me
So I'd be curious for you, is there something that got you excited about Airbnb in the first place?
Had I not watched the videos, it would've been informative being totally honest with you.
My mom and dad, they own an electrical wholesaling company and eventually I wanna take that over
Cause I normally, I'm serious, I normally don't call numbers that I don't know back
I lady showed this to my parents this past weekend and they're like, Oh, I finally get what you're doing now, <laugh>
I just checked on my boxes here
Whenever I do down payments for something, I just plan ahead and put money on the side and I use that
I got some money from that and then I had rental income
By day? Tomorrow I'm working from eight to two
So just wanted to be fully transparent with you and make sure you could make it
Okay. And then here, ballpark here, what's your current annual income
I mean if you didn't have any of those, I a little bit worried quite frankly, but Right
Would I be able to do the two o'clock one
Not while driving or walking the dog or anything
Well you're good to go, Don
Well Sherry, you, I won't be able to be on the call too much longer
Right now? Probably at a seven, Right? OUTTA seven.
So that's something that you're saying is currently how people are more so being able to run and function
Now I need to look at their calendars first, but
So anyway, long story short we were considering getting purchasing the training and let's see, B B formula, right? Is it called Bmb formulas
Where are you at right now? One through 10
For the most part that's what I'm looking for.
Okay. You know what, no, let's, let's look back at Saturday. What times did you say on Saturday? Again?
Awesome. So Joe, ballpark range, what's your credit score at right now?
I didn't. I was away for a military class and was right in the middle of all these briefings and stuff.
And I have that and there we go
But yeah, voicemail, text, message, and we can go from there and definitely be willing to hear
All right, man. What's Sounds Good's your first name, Good getting to know you.
Do Jordan and Steve? I'll sell my last name
It'd be nice to throw some money in a pot for them
So I pay for it all in cash
You can just, yeah, it's just like a 60 minute phone call
Cool. Let's do it. What time zone are you in?
And then the second thing they look at typically is annual income before taxes
That's definitely a big motivation for a lot of our students
I wanna make sure you Yeah, yeah
Pastor is German and the I US is Greek, Italian, Some Italian but the root word to store is from Northern Germany.
Okay, I gotcha. Anywhere and it doesn't sound like you would stop there,
If you wanna send me the link
I'm gonna email that to you right after we get off the phone
I'm kind of a gotten the green light to do whatever I can to get people better information or help them get results
Okay. And in the meantime, please send me the member area access or whatever, at least. Let me just double check. Yeah, because
And you're in Eastern time zone?
<affirmative>. Gotcha. So how much more of an impact would you be able to have it say 10 or $15,000 a month?
Would 11:00 AM or 1:00 PM work better for you?
<affirmative>. Right. Yeah, of course. And were you able to go through that entire course?
Oh cool. I'm glad I understand you and I feel like having an Airbnb business is gonna help you get there
Oh yeah. <affirmative> as long, I'm making it a excess of one 50 a year. That'd be great.
So it looks like 5:00 PM is available with Mr
Do you have a credit score?
<laugh>? So there's just two more things. Three minutes. Just so that,
Awesome. Yes, you go to 5K a month and then hit 10 K a month and just go beyond.
You said you could cash them with them? I haven't actually owned the properties that
I have two kids now I wanna just stick to two, three incomes and just go with that
Oh, it's Cooper over at BP's
And that'll give you a very, very solid understanding of the business model, how it works, how you recommends doing it
A hundred dollars compared to their normal 1000 that that's a huge range and just a big old blank space on their calendars
Yeah, I'm a real estate agent.
And the only other last thing before the call is Mr
So looks like we're locked in
Oh yeah. Okay. And then how much would you need to be at the place where you wouldn't have to get another job after retirement?
And this my, should be my direct work line that I'm calling you from
I mean, two grand a month would be super cool when we look to implement it at
Okay, gotcha. And again, just full context, you're not saying we have to use it, but roughly what your available credit is on there?
So real quick, refresh my memory man
I could travel there and stay at my own property
And really I'm here to connect with our students and see if there's any way I can help them
Brian is, Yeah, Brian's out in South Carolina that's where his headquarters are
Ka Funk needs to figure out what's best for you, man
Yeah, I can tell you though, I don't really at this time want anybody pulling my credit because I'm trying to build a house. Oh
No, I realize you got so much time to be on the phone
So Freeman, were you able to actually get started with Airbnb or what's going on?
So I'm allowed to hook you up with free resources to get you better results, to get you farther down the line
So he's not losing money, it's a win-win
Yeah. So I guess, do you have another job currently that you're doing?
Not tying up a lot of capital but getting the revenue out of it
Saturday I'm going to be a Wow
Basically give you a call and then just dive into where you're at and figure out how they could help you
So if you decide to move forward to have a coach, how much will that cost you?
So just wanted to be fully transparent with you and make sure that you could make it
So Luke, it sounds like Airbnb is something that you're potentially interested in
But I mean I could probably work out which Thursday, Thursday could probably work out
I do the directing because I found that I have to <laugh> something that I have to do
So not an insignificant number it sounds like, but okay
Yeah, I remember. Yeah. I actually just got home with I caught a flight earlier today, but I just got it taken care of.
I've already sold 40 houses this year
Yes. Yeah, I mean I have to.
Hey, I'm doing well. Sorry, I wasn't really sure how to put you on hold here. I guess I just completely asked you there. My bad
Gotcha brother. Yeah. How much do you know about the rental arbitrage business model?
But I'm here to hook you up with some free resources
And these guys, they have a ton of information on what's going on right now in the market and I'll check and see
Well dude, I mean don't worry about not having started yet
But we did a lot of work
Cause initially it's a thousand and then you get the other package
Do you mind helping me fill it out real quick? It's just three quick questions
And you said you've been doing that since earlier this year. What month did you start doing that?
No, I do not. I'd say conservatively probably seven 20. Seven 40.
If you got multiple Airbnbs, how much would you hope to be making?
Like you're saying what would happen
Hey Wayne, you there? Yes, I'm here man
Yeah, I always tell myself I need to get to the point of 10 K a month
Everyone's on the same call because everyone has their own questions
All right. You're welcome, my man. All right. Yes, Thomas.
Yeah. So what's your actually take home per month?
I do. I am partner with someone on this Airbnb that I'm gonna set tomorrow, but the other ones it'll be just me.
I'm only gonna lock this in if you're outta 10
That only take me about an hour
So I've got Dodge seven fifty@yahoo.com.
They've actually never been higher in history
Well heck with money you'd be making from Airbnb. You could do that every few
It was a while back, I think.
Catherine what was that last name?
<laugh> Yeah is like bounce with a C counts
Yeah, for sure. And were you ever considering doing the rental arbitrage model?
I think, oh fuck, just put down 60.
Do you know any of your students any success stories in and around the Houston area? That's where I live.
For, is that for each property?
Have a great rest of your weekend
Don't a small rural Montana, I don't see anybody grabbing that
Just take about 20 to 30 minutes
I wanna stop but I gotta keep pushing right now after do this for a whole year
Allow you to be one of those wealth building things
Do you want to just see what's going on in your calendar and we can see if maybe we can squeeze something in?
There's plenty of things I can do with 20 or 30,000 a month
Now when leasing properties, it should be listing on Airbnb
The first question is what's your credit score?
If I take the time to email that to you, will you watch it before?
So just to clarify, when you said the 10 notes, is that by N 2022 N of 2023 or longer?
It's sounds like it's more of a tool just to help more people
Okay, let me look that up real quick. Interesting. So the council said what now? It's completely illegal if you put up an Airbnb in Vacaville.
I know a lot of people in the credit game, so pat yourself on the back there
That would be awesome. That would be absolutely awesome.
I'm usually in a good mood
And you just need the right information and the guidance.
So we'll just jump down into it
That's what I would do with that
So for you were you able to get started with Airbnb or what's been going on?
Inflation doesn't matter if inflation goes up a hundred percent because the apartments and the units go up with it
I hear you <laugh>, I hear you
It's been a little, that's part of the reason it's been a little very frustrating the last month
No. Yes, but I haven't traveled as much as I have some classmates so that I got moved to a different position. So that's going on
And what would be the end, the end goal? What would be the purpose of the meeting with them?
But the few that did had incredible success
I'm running all over the place, man
Out and you make the difference.
Tomorrow or Oh no on Friday. On Friday. 12:00 PM Friday.
All right. I'll do it. I'll go ahead and lock it in for you and make it happen.
Hey Jeff. This is Cooper with BN Beach Formula. I'm Brian Page's team. How you doing?
What would you do? Would you go on trips or do stuff for your family or what would you do with that much income?
What would you do if you had unlimited money? Unlimited free time
Okay. Wow. That's actually a lot better than most people I talked to. Good for you.
On your calendar, since you are a pretty busy guy,
Okay, well I think that's everything
You can get more and create more cash flow
Okay, I see. Will they send a prees or saying, Hey, we had this appointment today or anything like that?
That's what that would mean to me
If it's a requirement for the meeting on Tuesday, then we probably should cancel and you probably should save that appointment for someone else.
Now that Covid is done affecting the Airbnb business, actually only affected the Airbnb business specifically for about four months
Cool brother. Now I got LI or gmail.com, is that the best email or do you want me to update that?
That way you're not tying up a to of your capital in one property
I do not. That has the money, unfortunately.
What was good, Good talking to you, Aja
Could you just open it up and accept it really quick?
And why is building generational wealth one of your top priorities?
So yeah, if you wanna email me a copy of it, I'll take a look at it
So I'm not, no, I'm not here to sell you anything
Actually, you know what we would definitely want you to a hundred percent commit to the time
Okay, gotcha. Yeah, it's a good move, especially in the winter times.
Well let's hope it holds anyways, Richard, I just wanna let you know that you're totally normal
He's got, he likes to throw things down the toilet. Oh
I'm on my laptop. Do I go online?
Cool man. So usually people don't invest into a course, an ideal income or result they're looking to get, right. So what is that for you?
So I'm excited, we got to have a conversation here
This is the actual properties itself
Well hey, usually people don't invest about a thousand dollars into a course unless there's a specific result they're looking to get to
That's one of the best reasons I've heard for getting into Airbnb all day
Yeah, that should be the right one
<laugh>, he fair enough. <laugh>. Yeah. And
So now Tric, I'm excited to see what goes to, because it sounds like you could really crush it with this
I've got the first and last name, Jeffrey suski gmail.com. Yep.
How much time do they need?
Well the man, it's been awesome talking with you
And also how do you do this minimum time you a ton of money
I mean we even have a guy on our team doing his revenue is gonna be 1
Honestly, Toren like, I don't mind
That's something we're from the worst at the moment and also gonna be doing Airbnbs
By the way, what crypto are holding right now?
These guys are do way more in depth Airbnb stuff
No one here by that name. Hello? No one here by that name.
I do have a couple Airbnbs of my own already
I would say more the eight to 10. There you go. I mean,
And I invested myself in that course and the rest is history
I mean, I bought the program I gave her ago talked to many people, especially in the Phoenix area
But my biggest thing was where I'm located, it's not really that popular cuz I'm in a rural community
I prefer you send it to my email, although I don't object to you sending it to my text
The headline is called Welcoming, warm, and Comfortable
I see you. I appreciate the opportunity.
Brian Page asked me to give you a call to see how you were doing with Airbnbs
And so now that Covid is not affecting the Airbnb business any longer, it's really just kind of exploded
He's doing over six figures of the Airbnb portfolio and he's just killing it
So three bedroom, two and a half bath
So we were just kind of doing that
I just want to feel just starting with my house would be easier
Okay, so I'm set up for Wednesday
Yeah, I don't Mercedes and the BMWs there they alright
This is kinda what I'm thinking here
And then, I'm not gonna lie January, February are the toughest months
So for you man, what would you do if you had an extra 20 to $30,000 a month coming in? What would change for you?
If you recall, you got his book a few weeks back on how to become financially dependent with Airbnbs
So I mean, if I could get a push in the right direction, I definitely wanna move forward with this
I now have a super successful business and I'm only working about two to three hours a week
How much would you wanna make ideal income
Big time right now or it's pretty much just my paycheck but luckily we don't have a mortgage on my home, on our home
Don't seem like it but you do
Okay. Do that every day with my profession, so
Cause five, I feel like 5k a month, you don't need too many properties, you need a decent amount
<laugh>. Sonny, pleasure to meet you Sonny. I'm Thomas.
That now I have to take a look at the calendar first, but does that sound good? Do you want to that?
To another place right at noon
So which time zone are you in?
But obviously if you can decrease your hours and still be able to earn some residual income, that's obviously something you guys are after, clearly
It sounds like you kind of have a rough idea of a 30 k month
So it looks like they're booked up the rest of the week, but we do have a few thoughts open on Monday
All right, looks like you're in for Mr
And they have the awareness, they'll be able to actually do things a lot faster. Correct. So money accelerates things
So what do you bring at home each year in annual income
But I didn't get on their, a specific meal plan that they had or
The owner was great in his interaction, I would assume that you don't have many properties cause he was very, very much hands on
So yes, I know a little bit about the fitness industry as well
Yeah, I'm familiar with that process and I think that was kind of the main point of the course, wasn't it, in a way? Yeah,
Yeah, maybe if I move around maybe I'll be able to hear you. Go ahead.
So yeah, I just paid those down
Dana, what time zone are you? What time zone are you in
And then you can just go from there
Unless they want, Unless they want bank
So on our team, we have full time executive consultants, so these guys are light years ahead of me
Okay, so just quick questions for you before we pull up the calendars here
<affirmative>? Yep. Okay. Okay. Exactly. So some people have a lot of cash going in, some people don't, right? It just depends.
I wanna be able to just be at home, do something that I like, and then be, generate income and create wealth
I'm sit my Wednesday and what's the meeting? Who is being Airbnb right there?
Okay. And just to double confirm, before I lock in here, you're a hundred percent good to go for two 30 Central tomorrow. No conflicts.
So if you can help me do this, then we can work together here
The speed of execution that I like about it cuz you can just talk
If it'll be beneficial, definitely. And if it's affordable. Okay. Yeah,
I mean, I was just curious, which,
Yeah. Awesome, Sean, Dude, I hope you have an amazing day and an amazing week and just kill it, man.
But that gives me time to do research on properties and read books and all stuff like that
Eight hours a week doesn't sound bad at all. Sounds doable.
You don't see the sun for months on end
Only reason I ask, because that video is so important
Yeah, I mean, don't take meetings like that always
Oh no, this won't be pulled at all this, this is not like
Yeah, I don't have, I just need a more enough time. Yeah. So,
Jackson just makes sure that anyone I place on his calendar like this watches an important pre-call video beforehand
And income is essentially, they typically look at your W two s in terms of what is being reported or if you have investment income
Yeah, that can be, yeah, one term for it. Yeah, partnering with someone else. Okay. So are you looking at
No, but it's not a message but I'll, I'll just get a hold of him later and just tell him to jump on.
Get even more. Yeah, for sure. Mean do you wanna leave anything behind or do you wanna give back or anything like that too?
Me trying to set myself up for that first deal is the toughest part
Even if I can make one to anywhere from one to 3000 a month, I know maybe that's too realistic
I mean, it sounds like you haven't put it to start yet, but you're definitely still interested in it a little bit
<affirmative>. And so are you doing the Airbnb business with your son and your nephew and your wife if you guys doing it all together?
I see a serious opportunity in helping you
Just takes about 20 to 30 minutes
My a girl I'm dating is she makes appointments and she doesn't, and they canceling her all the time
Awesome. So which time would it best for you? Actually really quick, what time zone are you in?
So just based off what I'm seeing here, it looks like they are pretty packed the next few days
And I know your time is incredibly valuable too, but typically the consultants are doing a thousand dollars per time slot
I'd say comfortably I could put like 20, 25 without uncomfortably probably like four, 4,000
Yeah, well I suffered a bankruptcy, so
So let's go ahead and do that
Your phone number Yeah, I will
What we found, honestly, is that most of them never ended up having success just cuz they didn't get started <affirmative>
No, if I got there faster than I thought I'd keep climbing
Would you and your wife be able to watch it?
Okay, let's see if I can get you scheduled in on that time.
Have those concerns about the leasing model from landlords and didn't get started
And then the person's like, Hey, this is, I think we got scheduling with Miss Catherine Funk, so hey, this is Katherine, blah, blah
Just wanted to, I don't think that should be an issue for you
Oh no, you can't do that and the card is probably invaluable. I probably got a new card
So you said building costs was really high right now and you're kind of talking about managing the teams
She has to feel like it's not a burden
Oh, awesome. Edward, this is Thomas with b and B Formula from Brian Pages team. How you doing tonight?
I mean, you could probably call the worst time in the last month
Wow. So sounds like this is absolutely essential to get going for you.
It's just a few questions would you mind helping me fill out really quick?
They work directly with Brian Page and regularly get paid $2,000 for just a single hour of consulting
Hello? Yeah, we're looking at March 2nd here.
Gotcha. And it looks like we do have a few thoughts open today. Would 3:00 PM or 5:00 PM work better for you?
Do you want me to share it?
Okay, understood. And then just not saying you'd have to use it of course but just full context, what's your crypto balance at ballpark
But yes, I'm on Eastern time at the very moment and I probably should be and what will be for the next few weeks
Thomas. Thank you Thomas. Thank you for this call.
Mean, for sure. How could you help your mom?
We recommend for the first one, we recommend for the first one for it to be somewhere within about an hour's drive from you
Right Dude, that living with your mother-in-law.
They'd rather stay in Airbnb, their own private house or something and then cram into a hotel with a bunch of people
I mean, if you just did the math there
For the next two days, sounds like you have a lot going on for sure
What I mean just the fact that you're review based and want everything kind of a high standards kind of a thing
But I was already working it, but the thing about it was C hit
So put it in there as a consultant
No, I think I'd probably go Airbnb. Yeah, definitely Airbnb.
They work directly with Brian Page himself and regularly get paid $2,000 for just a single hour of consulting
From Brian Page's team. You recall getting his course awhile back starting the Airbnb business?
And again, I really think it's gonna be for to start taking that's not so nott
I don't wanna track <affirmative>, the type of element that I attract
Cause the property I at now is close to downtown
Being able to apply that to the right opportunity
And so that's been the challenge
Yeah, honestly I used to do meal pens but now I track calories too
No distractions, pen and paper, ready to take some notes, ready to learn a couple things
Okay, no problem. I can do that. So how do I do that?
That would be impressive, man. That would be impressive.
Are you seeing it Lorenzo? You there?
And you are good to go for your call
But it's confusing as you can see
Yes, Yes. Oh, you could call me Google
And then between your HVAC businesses and anything else you're doing, how much are you bringing home each year in annual income from that?
My son's eight, he's growing up pretty fast
Like a dollar amount in profit per month.
Could you go ahead and open it up and accept it really quick?
My credit score right now is six 80.
So in a perfect world, no boundaries
Then one lead to two probably.
Okay. In fact, that's, You shot your book?
So in a perfect world, let's just say you have any boundaries
Okay, so we'll just keep it at 11 then. Okay, awesome. So it'll be 11 o'clock on Friday for your time.
That's amazing. You also said traveling. Where would you go first? You started traveling?
So I don't see any reason why I wouldn't
And then we already covered annual income earlier
It was used to be in the seventies
And what I'll do for you, I'll send over a calendar invite right now to your email Wisdom under Space Enterprises zero one Yahoo
Yeah. And yeah, I mean I just continue to invest it.
Well, my biggest problem is that I know I need coaching
A lot of I'm doing right now, but also a lot of traveling as well
Okay. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay. I didn't, The name doesn't ring a bell, but I do remember.
They're a lot more quotes to actually get new results than I am
What would I travel to? I would wanna take them to the Disneyland that's over in California
Okay, cool. Yeah, so I was just wondering for you a couple things here but firstly, were you able to get some traction with Airbnb?
You're not gonna be charged if the partner doesn't want to do it and doesn't want to get on the call
Let's see, hundred dollars due, pay the a hundred dollars. Okay. Pay now. All right. Paid.
I'll definitely be able to do it
You can talk to 'em if you want to and get references, talk to the landlords and then it snowballs from there
The only other thing is Mr
Yourself? No, I'm renting. I'm renting.
And if you could do that, do you feel like you'd be ready to go?
I don't have anything written down right now for one
Technically I would be leaving work, so even seven 30 or eight would be perfect. I usually get home by seven 15.
I need to be able to replace her income and move her and my sister down here
Yeah. But Geraldine Murphy is good. And
I mean is that something you'd be opposed to doing?
I think that one is just sitting at 12,000 credit and I think there's eight, seven or eight available.
Well, I mean, at least at this stage, it's like a lot of people would rather stay in an Airbnb if they're gonna travel
They work directly with Brian Page himself, and these guys are regularly getting paid $2,000 just for a single hour of consulting
For both or just for one or
No oi, give about 30 seconds here and I'll also send over a calendar invite to email as well
And then I know you have a let's see here
We're both young and we're both ready to go and we just don't feel like we have the ability to do
Mean, Yeah, no, no. I forget the small fucking thinking. You can't waste your time on thinking.
Just wanted to triple check just cause we do have a policy to charge a hundred dollars cancellation or reschedule fee for these appointments
If I got to where your boy's at, where he is making you said 1
You can buy your own, but that is more capital
That's how most people get into it
I actually work with Brian and I'm assistant manager for him
Not really, but I'm starting the business and stuff
But are you familiar with how to access the course and how to log into it and go through it?
I mean, I've just started working on the business last month
So that should be all that Mr
Cool. Yeah, so does that all make sense?
Yeah, thanks Todd. Great talking to you and we'll talk soon. Okay,
Jackson, just make sure anyone I place on his calendar like this watch is an important pre-call video beforehand
You're already in a building where you need to convince the landlord to turn these into Airbnbs
Does any of that sound like be beneficial to you?
My spouse just runs the finances. I do the decision making.
It? I mean it all just depends
Oh, of course not. No. First question, what's your
Just takes about 20 to 30 minutes
If I wanted to reach out and see how your Airbnb journey's going so far
Let's tell you what she, I'll go ahead and lock that in for you, for Mr
Oh yeah, dude. Like I said, that's pretty exciting.
So first thing to look at obviously when you're gonna get a lease is your credit score
I'm actually really slow on the course just because we are fixing up our house and we're almost, we're like probably 80, 90% done
What time is zone you in?
Yeah, is there any reason I wouldn't do what with the call
The only other thing call is Mr
If I send that over to you, if I text it and email it, could you wash that before your call next week?
Yeah, let's see what the questions are.
Well, yeah, a 10 for sure because I can't believe you called me
And so what are you bringing home each year in annual income?
Yeah, let's see. I'm meeting, gimme a second.
Oh man. I mean I would like about $6,000 a month. You hear me? Can you hear me? I can hear
I will lock this in for you, Chris
So I'm curious just cuz it sounds like this is something you wanted to do in the first place anyway
Hey David, This is Cooper with BNB Formula. Brian Page's team. How you doing?
Or is it No, just like a phone call
That would get you at that point you could get 10 Airbnbs a month more than that
Oh yeah. I just gotta keep hustling, figuring out, getting creative, I mean not easy <affirmative>.
Miami is booming with entrepreneurs and I want you going to Miami soon
And the reason why we have that policy in place is just obviously because we want to protect our executive consultants time
So our executive consultant as a context, they need to help figure out which properties you should after first
I'm trying to do better with that property, trying to figure out other things with it
I mean that's something you'd be opposed to doing
And then there's one less important thing
Wow dude that, that's amazing to hear the Don man I feel like this should be big for you man
And you've been And what is a former job? Former
I'm not really sure what their deal is, but I'm a very close with a couple of them on our team
I've got some things we might be able to make work here
So this will be your confirmation
So you're probably looking at, I mean you'd probably be looking at anywhere from three, maybe six months to replace it
Hey, I need to find my wallet
So that is changing our tax reporting last year, our gross taxable before all K one s and all that sort of stuff was around $550,000.
You talking about what you got? Well, I'm talking about timeline in essence of how long it'll take to get it going.
You can kind of check it out and find the people you relate to
Oh wow. Yeah, that makes sense.
That's awesome. And are you trying to retire your mom or trying to retire your parents?
Modo just so that he knows what you can get approved for as far as Airbnb leases and stuff like that
So the only other thing is I'm required to fill out a couple things so that Mr
Could you just watch that before your call?
We've seen some things that happen that does that kind of sound where you're at
But that's been bounced me around pretty close to the house
So I'm with B and B formula, so I work with Brian Page
I'm gonna email that to you right after this
Well yeah cause I did like the fact that I can move paper
So were able to get started with Airbnb or what's going on?
But stack, Stack travel, that's it
And to be honest, that's a bit outside of the scope of what we do
That'd be about what? 14? 14,000, 15,000 of a week? A month or a year? Excuse me
Well okay, so let me ask this now
I feel like this truly feels this could be it for you
<affirmative>, it would allow me to grow faster, put more money into other places, expand faster
Then say you make $6,000 from bookings, then you would pay back the landlord the 2000
Yeah. I'm trying to understand what do you mean by the process?
I would have rental properties to bring the income
I'm not sure if you answering the questions, but
Is this? Just wanted to double check
I just never knew how we could get into it and never had the money
I don't think I won a hundred thousand dollars car
But it's basically what we've seen here on our students
I'll let you go, I'll let you get back to your day and we'll talk soon
And then you said your construction worker and also security for living? That correct? Shirley, you there?
And I didn't realize that I had got a deal
Yeah, let's do it. Let's go for it. <laugh>.
Okay. And two of the properties you said just there's no bookings at all.
You ordered Brian Page's book on how to become financially dependent with Airbnbs
You're not able to show up to the call focus, you know, just randomly cancel no show something like that
So you're probably wondering why am I reaching out and giving you a call
And they're the best in the business of what they do
<affirmative>. Yeah. How do you think that would help your relationships if you didn't have to travel so much?
Yeah, Java King 21 Gmail. Yeah.
You got a great vision and I love to see where you're headed
And then just, kids are kids
We've obviously got the weekend here coming up
And then the rebound was so strong in May that I'm like, Hey, I've gotta scale this
Okay, I'll send it over anyways and then, you know, can take a look at it but Awesome
So I'm excited to see what goes to you
Absolutely. Or spend it to where I don't have to be relying upon being out of town all the time.
Is it gonna be at FaceTime or just a phone call like this or
You guys aren't able to show up to the call focus, you just randomly cancel or no shows something like that
Typically it's a thousand dollars slot, but I'm gonna waive the fee for you here
Well that's what I'm trying to do. But I have to see do more strategy. I think for me when it's
I don't want to just stay flat
It's gonna be there and it's not gonna just overnight just disappear
Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah, so it sounds like the go ahead.
And I haven't really got to it yet I guess
8 16 16. Gotcha. And then how much do you bring in home each year, an annual income from the different projects you have going on?
Airbnbs also not actually purchasing the more so just renting it from all the current landlord?
I forbid I leave sooner than later
It might take 15 seconds or so
Cause I know this is kind of in depth and kind of explaining to you on the call here
And then as a part of his consulting process, he just wants to make sure that he's helping everyone in your business
All right. So you say you're Cooper?
Gotcha, gotcha. And you have a specific income goal you wanted to hit?
And do you know ballpark, in terms of just it, it'll help determine for Mr
Let's break that down. I really control for each. Let's break that down. Where are you at?
Saw? Hold on one second. The
Could you do a 1230 or a one 30 today?
<laugh>. Yeah. It's a good habit at
Well, hell yeah, I think so too
So it's just three questions here I gotta fill out
More so the long term investments
But that sounds like it totally is more of a starting place
You brought that up because I will let Mr
So I guess my question is, in a perfect world, let's just say you didn't have any boundaries
So it sounds like this is pretty important to make this work for Airbnb,
Temps who's a superstar, but Mr
Alright. I've had some people who forget their passwords, so then we gotta go through a tech support for the process
I know this is a pain in my ass
So ultimately, I mean, you're looking for probably 10 to 30 to $20,000 a month or 20 to 30,000 a month actually
I do see some serious opportunity in helping you
Well I say we cuz it's me and my wife
Yeah, yeah, I do. I do.
And then yeah, family time is a big part of it
And how long ago was that?
So I don't know if we a couple hours ahead or behind you guys, but for me anytime, Go
Some people wanna make an extra $50,000 a month
It is, but just most of the time I'm always moving around doing something
So I am super pumped to for, again, get this thing started
Okay, great. So do you want me to talk to them now or are you gonna schedule a call?
Wow, wow. And you're making the move now. That's amazing.
You have three kids still at home
Yeah, but like I said, I actually make less than 1600 a month.
So what I do is I use my credit card so I can get points for them and then I pay 'em though
Now, obviously, if that's the case, well then that does require a higher level of investment, does cost money
And you can be totally honest with me
Oh that one I'm not too sure cause I've been doing that for now for three to four years now
My wife does have a full-time job and she'll probably keep doing that until retirement, which is 65
So just wanna make sure that that's a hundred percent good to go
You're looking to increase your potential from a five to 10 to hopefully a 10 outta 10
5 or two, it'd probably be three to four times
6 76. Got it. Okay. And then ballpark here, but your current annual income?
Okay. I'll send it to your email and you'll be able to show it to your partner too, right?
I'm actually looking at getting another property in Alabama right now
All right, thank you. I appreciate you being able to commit to that call.
I don't always wanna be in a position where I feel like others are helping me, I wanna be helping them
Okay. I also have a two 30, a four o'clock and a five 30 in the afternoon. Central time tomorrow
If I'm making that much money, I would like, Oh honestly, I'm not really a car guy
May take a second to come through sometimes. Have you seen anything come through yet?
So you're looking at 300 a year grand, 300, 3 23 50 grand a year to be financially independent
Yes they do. Yes they do. So Jerry, are you in Eastern time zone?
I picked up the book cause I saw one of the ads I read it
I need 3000 a month just to live, I mean with basics <affirmative>
They can take them to the next level
Is this something that you're looking at getting into relatively soon?
Well so sounds like right now you guys are just probably missing a few pieces to really get going with Airbnb
I'll do for you as well since it looks like, might been like a year ago you got the course or something like that
Well, a month off of Airbnb, they have two properties and they be newer properties, <affirmative>
Yeah, I mean I feel like all of those would apply. I would do all those things. What you just said,
Yep. Why Airbnb? Does it gotta be this? Cause you seem super gung-ho about this business model.
Now I am really, Last time I had it, I also was looking for my wallet cause I moved it
Yeah, I have about 2000 in cash or in my savings
That's what I do here, that's what I love to do
Well, I've actually, with this covid and stuff like that, I've actually had to take from that
Yeah, I think, and I said you kept investing
All right what we can do here then on that. You said next Friday, right?
So I would do it, I would do it
Yeah, you're exactly like my parents actually
So what really intrigues you is the financial freedom and the extra time that buys you.
So how does the rest of the day look for you today?
Let's see, how much was it? I think it was above 150. 150,000. Okay.
She may say, Hey, tell this number and she's actually our full time support
So it's just three quick questions here
Hold on. You said I must have misheard how you said your question. Say it again.
Yeah, this would be me making the decision. I'm the decision maker when it comes to the BMBs.
I don't think, or maybe it arrived and my wife put it somewhere but I don't recall receiving the book
Just to protect Brian's executive consultant's time
I mean I actually come from a very toxic family, so don't not that concerned about generation wealth
Well question for you mean, how do you feel that having an Airbnb business would help you be able to do that?
I had been to numerous banks and they had always rejected me because I just didn't have any proof
Awesome, Mike, I'll go ahead and lock that in 10:00 AM central time on Wednesday and I'll make sure to let Mr
So doesn't show up, makes you look bad?
This one job specifically? It's about 65 K a year. Right now it is 65.
But I mean I'm always, I'm a real estate investor, number one
So looks like we're locked in
I'm not big into fancy cars or anything
I really value you giving me your word on that man
I'd like to get back into it
Electrician. Do you like what you do right now?
Yes, but I'm familiar with it.
It? <laugh>. Yeah. So for you, why are you looking to create this passive base to be able to move out the industry?
I'm doing pretty good just over the road right now
Loughlin is a mini Vegas arena
Gotcha. Awesome, Manny. Well dude, I'm excited to see how your call goes and excited to see what you can do.
No, I have a loan on it now that I called you. I didn't have one.
And then at six months you'd be at 6,000 and at 12 months you'd be at 12,000
Also. You okay. Also if happen to know your, do you roughly your wife's availability?
Well my job here is to see if I could help our students in any way possible
Damn Cooper man, tell Brian this is a fucking brilliant, brilliant, brilliant direction and what a wonderful addition to check in
Right. I'm gonna hold you to that man.
Yeah, we can make that happen.
Legacy. What do you mean by that?
Okay, gotcha. What time are you off tomorrow?
And you can do a lot more with me
I know I have an appointment at appointment at 12 or 1230 and then I work out in the mornings
Yeah, I'm definitely interested in this
Wrong. Actually the eighth is Wednesday.
So it'd be some that we think that could at least get us heading in the right direction
Yeah, I'm pretty good. How are you?
And ideally, how many hours a week would you like to be working?
And just taking notes from your book, your success story and the money that you're making and stuff like that
And so it's literally just to protect against our consultants having blanks based on the calendar
We went to the really, we bought our own
Most importantly, always to have money makes the world go around
We're probably gonna put 10 K into the designing it and furnishing it
Okay. And for credit score, do you know a ballpark range within 50 or a hundred points of where it's at?
No, I should be free about that time. Everything should be taken care of.
So if it was an extra 500, a thousand or $2,000 a month, that's something significant to me to where I understand
That way you can start building equity, which will allow you to buy more and more and more
My dad always worked a low paid job all of his life and we struggled all the time
You know what I'm saying? But I do believe that I can do it
Cool. So it's nine 15 where you're at
That's a march. And then February it was 67. January it was 75. So I'd say 70 is the range.
So 10:00 AM mountain time on Monday, December 6th
You'd like to actually be able to do that though,
And then, let's see here, that should be it here
So I have an idea of what resource I think could be a huge needle mover for you
But you always carried yourself great
And then, so your call's at 12:00 PM have you set an alarm for 1150?
So if you're not able to show up to the call fully focused, you know, just randomly cancel or nohow something like that
It's Christian with b B Formula and Brian Page's team.
Where's super important that you watch? Where
Thomas. All right. Well Kim, you're welcome. I hope you have an awesome night and we'll keep in touch.
And so I'm gonna go ahead and send over a calendar invite the code of koon one gmail
And I mean you sound like a smart guy
I'm currently living in South Haven and the cheapest rental of all places is $1,600
Well the only other thing is Mr
And they ask us, they say, What's your credit score? What's your monthly income? Please provide pay stubs and bank account statements
So ultimately, what do you, I really want,
I mean business, it's how it is, right?
So whatever time is available, but well, like I said, right now I'm getting ready to go to work
Wow. So how many months has he been in?
Yeah, I can hear you. You're good.
Yeah, that you purchased the course?
That's the main reason why I actually was drawn to buying program by I actually followed Grand Cardone
All right, well tomorrow five 30. So you have
So I'm curious for you, I mean, what made you feel excited about Airbnb in the first place?
But I guess, yeah, cause this is my first go around even trying and starting my own brand and all that stuff
You don't have to really rush, but you want people in there
He hates when I do stuff like that just randomly
But I just kind of decided I wasn't willing to put the effort into finding those different management structures
Wow. You've been doing that for about 13 years now?
So unfortunately I can't do it Tuesday, Wednesday
So it's a really interesting way where you're actually able to scale up your monthly cash flow without coming out massively with liquidity
But yeah, that's really what we recommend and then you can spread out from there however you want
So that would either that or afternoons
Yes. You actually have lifetime access to the course. Oh great. You, yeah, you have it forever. So you, you're good in that front. For Deborah,
Yeah. I mean what time are you usually talking about?
Yeah, $2,000 a month will make me happy.
Okay. Yeah, no, that'd be cool.
It has to do with how the person thinks and the specific mental models that they operate with towards the Airbnb business
He just makes sure that a hundred percent, anyone I put on his calendar just watches an important pre-call video, just about 30 minutes
Awesome. Which one of those two work better for you?
Hell yeah man. You're cool as hell dude. I, Your whole vibe is
So mm-hmm <affirmative> that far from what I make, especially within the first three months
And that's a little bit on the low end
I'm currently on a couple of leagues
<affirmative>. Yeah, for sure. And the goal there would be to supplement what you're already doing or to replace it?
Let me get my glasses on cause there is a possibility that I gave to you incorrectly
I'm currently working on my credit. I don't know what it is. It's not too good.
Dude, Australia's been on my list for a while now
And obviously you're telling me a bunch of success stories which is awesome
I don't like, I'll probably know what you'll doing after this call is N York Lovely. A Yahoo. Your email? This
Was a while back. Yeah. I got you. Yeah. How's it going? Okay,
Wow. Well look at that. Yeah, look at that Friday morning and we got the timing locked in.
Renzi has all the context he needs
You're catching me right in the middle of a life move, man, so that's
<affirmative>. Yeah, I agree. So you're saying that you would have a lot more free time, is that what you're saying?
Cause in the book you says you can get it without actually buying a house
I think you were like Miss Funk, she has a few kids as well
Are you doing this by yourself or are you doing this with a business partner or potential spouse?
If I send that over to you after this call, text it over to you
Gotcha. Yep. That totally makes sense. Yeah, and
So I kind of just thought I wanna own the property outright
They do have a full conversation with you, 45 minutes, an hour long and they feel like you could benefit from it
Yeah, yeah man, let me just pull this up.
This is a company policy and it's protect against them having blank based on their calendars, just based off of past experience
Yet. I confirmed with her today if she was done for the day with her meeting, she told me. Yeah,
And you feel like maybe you want to have a little bit more of an impact on 'em than you do now?
Available cash on hand say 11,000 change.
No, I know that he will be fully supportive.
I have five laptops, I just buy new one
And then they stay here for the night and then they take off the next day and they head south
And then what I can do here is here's kind of my thought process on this
I don't know, I think when I said 10,000 I think that was like, okay now, now we're doing good
I'll just ask you a few questions and then put it in the notes just so the consultant has the information they need
He's got 14 properties on rental arbitrage and he's doing about $25,000 a month on profit
Cause normally they just hang up <laugh>
It looks like we do have a few thoughts available today
Good. I mean I can pretty much make time for a phone call at any time.
Just show up. You just say, Hey man, I booked tickets for tomorrow morning, meet me here, let's go. Yeah,
What would you use that for?
We don't do anything out here except one of the slaves to you
You're sitting right beside me doing up drawings for a house whore buying.
Would you mind helping me fill it out really quick?
And I like to get him over there back to his family sooner than later
Creating new things for the company that I work at, the company I work for
Okay. And then which time zone are you in?
So basically the way I think of it is kind of like a storage unit for instance
And I don't send them to daycare because we can't afford it
Could you go ahead and accept that really fast?
Hey Jack. It's Cooper with Bmb Formula. I'm Brian Page's team. How you doing?
Does. With the name read on the
What time if I have that? I'm in Central.
Okay, cool. In home or is that what it was? Yeah,
Oh yeah. So let's see. Okay, it looks like we are good to go.
Well, I haven't considered that. I don't know anything about it.
I'm also doing lease options, lease purchase options, Those are pretty cool
Cuz what if it's two hours away and you have to have a cleaning crew in there? They don't show up
It's in a good area, a lot of restaurants, things in that area
I just wanted to be fully transparent with you and make sure that you can make it
And so do you mind helping me fill out really quick, just a few questions
Like we've done this before and he's very risk adverse
Doing pretty good. How are you?
I'm retired from my job so I'm probably bring in about a hundred, 115
Oh yeah, pen, Pen in hand, paper in hand
Not, Thank you. That's the term I'm looking for. But I think my problem is
Then you get charged back on PayPal and they'll give you the money back. I mean that's like the worst case scenario.
The real experts at the Airbnb stuff are executive consultants
Yeah, I tend to go traveling quite a bit in the years period.
Essentially the premise of the book itself is actually how you can make an income on Airbnb by using other people's property
Nah. Yeah, we're doing the rental arbitrage right now. Okay,
Obviously a lot of people are after financial freedom and some of the similar things
Yeah, if I had leads I would do it
I, Cause we know that when we speak to people, oftentimes we can change the trajectory
Gotcha. And then right now, would you classify yourself as a real estate developer? What would you say your job title is?
And what, because kind of are newer to the whole Airbnb business and one of our goals here, brand, brand,
Well in the morning I've got a 9:00 AM and a 10 30 and then the afternoon's wide open
Cuz like I said, man, we looked into that and it's something that been on the tape
There's 168 hours a week, I can do the whole thing
I try to keep that balance right there
Seriously, it sounds like you're in the place for, it sounds like you're ready to make a change
I said January 3rd, January 8th
So it should be one 30 for you right now about Yeah,
Oh I would go a house in Jamaica and live there
Put some respect on the age
Okay. So 1:00 PM talk with Brian. Page consultant.
I mean hell, if the hotels are staying open, then there's enough demand
All right. And so for the card you're gonna use for the deposit, does it have a middle initial on it?
I don't want to get chewed out or lose my job anything anytime soon
Well, the reason that I'm calling, and don't worry, I'm not here to sell you something
So hear me out on this
Awesome. So you for sure be able to go through that maybe take some notes.
You obviously, you're obviously want help me because you wanna, if I make money, you're gonna make money somehow. That's what I'm getting out of it.
Okay. And do you think that if you had a successful Airbnb business that you would be able to do that?
Well, I guess mean just getting in it
Are you gonna be making the decisions in the Airbnb business or do you need her permission to make decisions?
Sometimes that's not what's you as individual?
And the landlord is never gonna have a tenant that's gonna clean their property that often
Well that's awesome that that's really good that you want to do that
So looking at tomorrow, as far as Pacific time goes, I actually have a couple slots now
My bank one is 6,500 and I guess Capital One is the last one that has a 3000 limit
Surpris some way down the road that we're both kind of in the aviation field
Basically it's credit score, annual income, sometimes capital available depending on credit score and income
So that's kind of what I do
So I'm actually allowed to hook you up with some free resources to make that happen
If I put someone on their calendar and then they just don't show up
Is that correct? And then basically
So make it for five, it's fine
Let me see if one of our executive consultants has some time to hop on a call with you
<affirmative>. So you're grow, you're growing a family right now and you just want to be able to maximize the amount of time with them.
Yeah, that's pretty much how I see it
And then let's say you reinvested <affirmative> and then you got some more money reinvested again, then you reinvested again
I'm gonna send you that testimony right now and dude, kill it
I want to be able to take them places cuz life is about memories
Hey man, you're in a great place to start
Well, for starters I'm working on W2 job
I should be able to make the call
I'm okay. I don't recognize who you are.
Just as far as the next two days I, I'm working
And just so you know, the way this works, it's super simple
Well, let's just take it one at a time
I'd say I got a savings with about 22.
Of course. And were you able to get started with your Airbnb business
We do have the Facebook and group of stuff right from bnb, but I need somebody in the real life I can talk to
So that's the market that I'm interested in
That point every month? I personally, I'd probably be able to narrow it out more for year
Okay. Yep. So is there a time on Saturday, do you think you and your husband would be free for a call?
But either way you're just gonna get a ton of value
Yeah, I know there's like three
Hers is, is a little lower and usually about 6, 6 20, 6 40 maybe is what hers is at.
<affirmative>, not doom and gloom, but just preparation better to have it not needed than the needed
I'm gonna put you with Mr
And just one last important thing before we wrap it up here
They figures out what is it
He also has in person one on one personal coaching that's like a hundred thousand dollars
They work directly with Brian Page himself, and these guys are regularly getting paid, I mean, 2000 bucks for a single hour of consulting
I was there in January and it was still such good weather
<affirmative>. And you said you got two properties now on Airbnb and why do you want this Airbnb business? What's the goal?
Yeah, my credit score is probably about a seven 50 plus.
Yeah, I have a partner that probably want that does some properties with me that'd probably wanna get into on it.
Is a good, I mean I don't know if you know or not, but I just want to ask what do people normally make with Airbnbs?
But I mean, I don't know
But I think that we can get that up even quicker
I value being able to commit to that
So the first thing to look at when you're going to get at lease is your credit score
Okay, cool. And you're in Alabama, so are you in central time?
But <affirmative>, those are not necessarily things that I really, there's a whole lot of other things I'd like to do
Glad we got to open this up here today and got to hear about what drives you and what's going on with you
Well Weston, I appreciate it. I'm really excited to hear how it goes and I hope you have an awesome day.
The one, if there's a link if to add it to your calendar, then that would be the best one.
Cool. And are you working a full time job right now?
Well I just think if that, like I said man, he can't replace quality time
And ideally, how much would you like to be contributing to causes like that?
I mean even in January it's mid to upper seventies
Yes. French extreme yahoo.com. Is that your email?
So that's like 45,000 Canadian or no, I'm
1126. 2026. And the code is 6 6 53 53.
Yeah. Okay. Well then we'll get you in for that 5:00 PM So
Oh, get more time where I could put in all my keyboard and do a little more writing and stuff,
I'm sorry, what was your name again?
And then whether they offer you the program or not, you still get a free call out of it from someone
Okay. Which one's best for you?
It was lawyer, so it was lawyers
Soon when you're making make enough from Airbnb, you can just pay someone to do it for you
My father worked on the Panama Railroad in the seventies when I was a kid
Yeah, that's fine. I'll watch the
And so you really, it's like I need some outside guidance to help you figure this thing out
My home ready for the call, I'll make adjustments to my schedule and make sure I'm available at seven on Tuesday, April. Awesome.
Otherwise, if it's gonna be a but since it's for 60 minutes
That should be everything that Mr
I have, but that's the question of the day. I gotta start purchasing property first. So in the future? Yeah,
I could maybe connect you with someone who could give you a better idea of what that looks like
So do you wanna just wait for that to come through real quick and you can confirm if I have the spelling right?
I ended up probably wherever he right around him,
Enough you just wanna sell and how much information they're interested in giving me coaching on
But it's also possible you could Airbnb it and so our executive consultant be able to advise you better on that
Is there any reason at all way you wouldn't be able to make it?
Yourself, I have to commit to this,
So really we would just be looking at Monday
Okay, Well, I'd like it to happen
So it looks like we got you scheduled in with Mr
So you have to rush around and all right now?
So yeah, that's where I'm at right now
I'm only gonna make about 25 on his property
Yeah, so he works, works close with Brian
Yeah. Which one do you have on file?
Then I'm just entirely relying on what I could put away so that we could do vacations because I don't have vacation pay
Is that kind of where you're at?
I'd have to have more than one property accomplish
Just recently I've just kind of been, I just kind of put it on the back burner
Not that I can think of.
I may have my team member, a couple of my executive assistants executive coordinators and support executives on the line
You guys are a lot more equipped to get your results than I am
If it's good for me, I'm all for it
And it looks like we've got you scheduled in with Mr
And also I'll send you over some 500 plus of our video reviews we have from people who've worked with Brian
I've got a couple, actually. I got a couple appointments, medical appointments, and then
Okay sure. You think it'll be valuable for you?
So Jerry, I think you should be pretty good to go here
And so is that right now, is that one of your main motivations for getting to Airbnb? Being able to retire
Most, I mean seven 12 or 7 0 7, that's the last time I looked at them
We saw that you ordered Brian's course a little while back and how to become financially independent with Airbnbs
So what do you wanna know?
And what we found is that a ton of people purchase that book
I'm young enough to make something happen still, and that's what I'm trying to do
Okay, right on. Only wanna lock us in if you're outta 10, so let's do it. What time zone are you in, Alex?
And just one last important thing
And Salvador, so obviously that sounds like it might just be more of a starting point, like a stepping stone
However, it's definitely important to have some checkpoints along the way
Yeah, I'll pull up another one of our consultants' calendar
That's like, that's a dream right there
Wow. So you got a lot on your plate right now sounds like.
Do you do right now for work?
And how do you feel that doing that for your daughter would impact her life?
So that's why I said 5,000 for me
And that land was supposed to house my clinic, the residential area and then have some area for Airbnb B and that's five acres
It was just eligible to apply for December 15th or first group that was approved
So it sounds like you're doing the soundhouse and there's a little bit of delay getting it ready
Sorry? Is that the video that you told me to watch before the meeting
But the reason I'm reaching out is I'm a student success manager for Brian
And huh? I was just gonna say it sounds like you're doing this with your wife along with you? Yeah
50 grand equity in the house?
I mean, I can't imagine it, but it makes sense, <laugh>,
Now I have to take a look at their calendars first, but how does all that sound?
We have people who do that
Okay. Yeah. Brian Pages in California.
I have a lot of weird investments that they jump around a lot
How about think, let think five o'clock on Friday,
Kim, I don't know if you remember or not, you have Brian's course a while back on starting the Airbnb business
Yeah, because think about it man, if you get five, six buildings, eight buildings don't seem like a lot
Just be you? No, I don't. Right now I'm so low at my business.
You bought a little book a while back, It's been a while
Yeah, yeah, I did. I think it was last year or two years ago. Cool.
Have I went as far as to purchase anywhere? No, not yet
To be 10 times smarter than everyone else?
Yeah. So there will be no charge for that, is that correct? I just wanna double check myself.
So do you know what your credit score is? Last time you checked
So I've even kind of focused on anything else but that at the moment
So all I do is try to raise our student success rate
Yeah, so financial freedom first off
So I think they're willing to make it happen
Oh, okay. I was think hoping you're in by somewhere. <affirmative>.
Just kind of tucking everything aside cuz this is not gonna go on forever
Cause how come we're, I'm only getting the choice, the choices of this much
You? Yeah man, let's do it.
You're welcome, Wally. Look forward to hearing how it goes for you today, man. Take it easy.
Thank you so much, man. I appreciate it.
Well listen man, I wanna help you out
That would be an insane, would be an insane robot.
Well, I'd work a little less, that's for sure
So <affirmative>, why I wanted to know, hey, do they currently do it as well too? Cause that's the best way to learn
Yeah, no, no, <laugh>, you don't need to, We're not gonna quiz you or anything, don't worry about that
Are you seeing it anywhere on the emails?
Cuz you sound like you generally sound like a guy
It sounds like at that level you just wouldn't even be worried about other income streams
How it goes. But outta the people that have,
Thank you. Yeah, have a good
So actually since you have a business, are there any ways you could leverage business credit with that in terms of business credit lines
Can you tell me a little bit more what you mean by that?
Oh, and then annual gross income before taxes?
And so we've actually had hundreds of multi six figure B beers
That's awesome that she at least got started there
And that's why we were able to be able to do this lake house <affirmative>
All right. You're welcome. bye. Bye.
Cause it's just time to do something else
Perfect. All right brother. Sounds good. Well great talking to you. We'll talk to you soon. Yeah,
Would it be an hour or half hour, hour type phone call, something to that extent, or,
Hut, <laugh>, I used to live behind aah hut in Tucson, Arizona,
Is that something you'd wanna do?
All right. Yeah, of course. Bye bye. Mm-hmm.
Yeah, no, I think you have tried a lot of things and yeah, stay safe
I understood. It's just three questions here. Do you know what your credit score is at
And I'd honestly, I'd just hate for you to ever have to pay that
And I'll show you an invite
And so Lou, just a few more things
Okay. And do you have any other sources of income you're bringing in or is that the sole one?
Monday? On Monday? Yeah I'll be in my office between nine and noon on Monday
It a video call? So just take a second here. Getting you finalized that What? Just a phone call.
And it's just to protect us having blank space on their calendars
Smith needs to figure out what's best for you
Little bit more passive income. Like you said, 20 grand a month, 25 grand a month coming in. Y'all be at the eight, nine level. Easy.
So I never actually did anything with it
Oh yeah, Flo, San Louis Obispo.
So do you have a quick second?
So yeah, you're looking to replace, well 5K a month is the revenue from the rental income, but that's not net
That wasn't, wasn't me. That was my son, but what's this about?
Mm-hmm <affirmative> five 30 and I can just let my girlfriend know too
I dunno if you recall or not
Okay. And you can merge the calls if you want.
I do see some serious opportunity in helping you
Where would you get your first?
I'll go ahead and email that to you after this, but it is a requirement
He has a hedge fund that buys hundreds of notes every day
There's nothing that brings them here as they head south
So it looks like that spot is open
Well, yeah, I, I own a window cleaning business right now and I definitely want to expand into other areas of business
And that would just be doing what we would consider the bare minimum working just two or three hours a week
These chicken barn, they probably generate 35 to 40,000 every three months, honestly, 35 to $40,000
That way I don't have to work anymore. I don't have to make my 10,000 <laugh>.
So I would say if anything happens with it at all, to be honest, I would be grateful for it
It's what I'm doing everything for
They work directly with Brian Page himself and they're regularly getting paid a thousand bucks just for a single hour of consulting
It's amazing the sort of numbers we're seeing with Airbnb
We gotta connect and I think I may have a super solid idea of how we can help you
I wanna lock you in if you're a 10
And there's a lot of, or I could even build Airbnbs once I get to that point
So how long have you been doing that for?
The only other thing, like I said Mr
And most probably about nine hours a day.
Well again, I don't necessarily really wanna stop working, doing what I'm doing, so I probably would still do it
So all these guys have personally done six and even seven figures with their personal Airbnb portfolios
The seventh, is there another day? I mean, I said maybe make something
What do you mean? What kind of money do I wanna make?
Hi, thanks. I appreciate the call. Come one one day.
So I'd be curious for you, was there something that got you excited about Airbnb in the first place?
So I just wanted to be fully transparent with you and make sure that you could make it
Dozens of people are even swimming at the seven figure mark
I'm gonna put you with Mr
Yeah, we've been working on it pretty much day and night for two and a half months
Oscar Moana. Tell Oscar I cancel all now what if Oscar don't show up? I get a hundred dollars
Right my man, it's been awesome talking to you. I'm gonna send it over to that video over to you right now.
Like I said, it's just how deep we wanted to go into it
Could also do something in the morning at around 10 or 1130
Well I appreciate the time, Sherry
Yeah, I mean that's actually, in terms of timelines and plans, that's like you're right there man
On a scale from one to 10, where do you feel like you're at now?
Rogers, just make sure that anyone I place on his calendar watches that super important pre-call video beforehand
Like right, I mean they're getting a period of time of lockdown rent
About to be two and four and then I have an eight year old.
Brian just gives me three, maybe five minutes to check in with you folks
Yeah. Tomorrow, if I get you in here, I can guarantee that this spot we blocked out for you and that nobody else
So Monday I've got an eight 30 and a three 30
Okay. So what's kind of a longer term goal? Ideally how much you wanna be making from all your Airbnbs.
Probably good. Gotcha. And do you have about 45 minutes available at 1:00 PM?
What's like that ideal monthly income you're hoping to get out of an Airbnb business?
Five o'clock on Friday? Yep. We have that time available.
It's a win-win for the homeowner
And I know a lot of apartment complexes, they kind of got hip to what's going on
The reason I'm calling is actually a manager for our student success team here for Brian
But I'll tell the team kinda what happened and they'll understand
His family's done well for himself
So not Zoom or anything like that, just over the phone
Yeah, for sure. Well, and what would that mean to you? How would things be different if you had that time Freedom.
And so you're like, Okay, this could actually work
It doesn't hurt me at all
I'm gonna send it over to you right now. Would you mind just opening it up and accepting it really quick?
Does that ring a bell at all?
<affirmative>, come on down, we'll show you
Well I thought they, he's got some good things going
Hey, it's Cooper p and B Formula, Brian Pages team. How you doing?
Yeah. Gotcha. What is the name of his company by the way? I just know him as Brian Page.
Okay, let me get in there. Christian Brown.
I can, I'm looking at Mr
Maybe a weekend and afternoon Or if it's gonna be turn a weekday it would've to be after seven
Four 15. So maybe four 30 would be a good one. Five.
As a ballpark, do you know your credit score?
And you're probably gonna see two emails from one hub saying something along the lines of your calls confirmed or you're confirmed with Mr
And at some point you're gonna build up
I don't understand getting all the knows and you gotta have the repetition, you know, gotta really believe in your crowd
We were young and we hadn't done much in our life
Yeah, ideally and I looked into it
Okay, looks like you are confirmed with Mr
Just have to search for it and it'd take me a little bit of time, but that's easier
So if you didn't have any boundaries, what's kind of that ideal monthly income you'd be hoping to get to with Airbnb?
So yeah, it's very, very doable
Houston, okay. <affirmative>. So it looks like we have a Monday open. We could do 1:00 PM on Monday,
Each year? So this year I just used some changes after the post pandemic, a changed job
And so that could be a great first property start bringing a few thousand
Do you have a car on base?
And then I live in Minnesota and so I think I want to know how is the Airbnb business in Minnesota
Have an example for your daughter
Now I need to take a look at their schedules first, but how does that sound?
Maybe a little drink in your hand
What was one word you would use to describe how you feel at that point?
It just takes about 20 minutes or so
So yeah, that sounds reasonable. What would you need to see for you to know that this would be a good deal for you?
And just talk with one of the consultants and the consultant is the ones that actually got you through the process? Is that what you're saying?
I'm gonna sit down and take notes
So just give you a quick rundown of the way Brian teaches Airbnb and I'll send over, send some stuff
And at that point you, you've talked about a lot of stuff so far in this class
I pretty much got a friend that's in the real estate business
That always lets us know that you clear the process
That wouldn't be fair to you
You should an email from Once Hub and then inside the email there should be a link to say add to Google calendar.
You don't have any negative outside influences, shall I say
We have the money set aside specifically for the air and b Airbnb already in case something did come up
I know it's not over a six 20 right now
I've been cutting hair for 17 years
Do I have no I guess no
Okay, sounds good. Thank you. I appreciate that
Stratton and I look forward to that text later on
You said? I had what now?
So the executive consultants that we have on our team, they work full-time far better at actually getting you results than I am
So I'd be curious for you, were you able to get any traction with Airbnb or what's going on?
The end of the day the money and the investments are more or less a tool to get what you want
Oh yeah, definitely. Okay. There's also five acres of land next to my house that I'd like to buy as well.
Nah, just be soon. Right? It's the card number.
I'm gonna shoot you a text with it right now and then you can let me know if this is good
I mean it's all based on numbers
I've invested a huge amount of money in trying to find my escape route
And it could, yeah, I mean
I got little holdings, but I can get access to a little bit enough to do something
I don't know about a hundred dollars
Is that something that you'd be opposed to doing?
Last time we check here was eight 16.
Good. I got some time today. I was having a crazy weekend. So how you doing today,
Maybe reported? Maybe about 3 50, 400.
I can fill it out over the phone
All right, sounds good. Thank you so much.
Which time zone are you in?
And so obviously that would free some time out with my family and whatnot
Rogers has the context he needs
Okay, cool. I'll email it to you and also touch it.
Okay. And so for you long term, what are you hoping to get to?
I have a vpn, I paid for it
You might have even actually just gotten the ebook
So we'll get you finalized in here and it looks like, see just finalized in really quick
There's nothing sensible about any poverty in the world
Yeah. Appreciate out with you for about a week.
Just a tool to get what you want
Haven't emailed it to you just yet. I'm gonna email it to you right now.
Cool. What time is going in?
10,000 limits. And have you spent any on them or do they all have 10,000 available? You don't have a balance?
I wanna know if they're currently doing it
So it's just me and my sister now to take care of my mom
Some people need two, people need 10
Gotcha. And then right now, are you working a job or you retired? What are you doing right now?
I I'm on the wrong date
How many properties are you hoping to get to?
That's kind of whenever I was thinking about the whole Airbnb type deal
You have some stuff lined up and you can get your first property from the first week of being there
Okay, perfect. Sounds good. All right. Shoot me an email. We can talk maybe in a couple weeks
Because there's definitely different ways to do it
So let's say you did that, right? You reinvested the earnings, you reinvested again, and then you reinvested again
Yeah. So just could you just remind me really quick, what are you interested in Airbnbs in the first place?
Exactly. And the cleaning fee goes on, the patrons. The visitors, of course they pay that,
Cause typically it is a thousand dollars time slot
But yes, that's that's love to get
So I guess it is really just how to enter the space in the most affordable way or most convenient way I should say
So there was no small investment?
Got it. Do you wanna pull up your for tomorrow, March 2nd, and just take a look at what's, what you got going on
That's totally fine, man. It's some people, they really don't have any available capital you.
This is what we're here for
But yeah, financial freedom to where I can take of my family
Yeah, I think I've only spoken to one other person who said billions, which I love that goal
The high end of what I was considering was a $2,000 a month
I looked at it yesterday, but I know I can get that up earlier this year
If I take the time to email that to you, will you watch it?
Oh hey. Sorry about that one. I was muted myself for a second. Am I back there?
But is it going to be in there? Do you know what number is going to be as far as Arizona or whatnot
Do you want me to share it?
Yeah, definitely. And I mean you feel like having an Airbnb business, having an additional residual income would help you get there.
Okay. Understood. Gotcha. And then do you have some capital saved up to actually go out and do some of these deals?
I don't even know how to answer that <laugh>. I just wanna be a bill at that point. <laugh>.
Yes, I'm currently working right now. <laugh>,
And we have some other forms of income too
That I don't have to go in and work a regimented job because I'm 55 years old
Well dad, obviously I'd probably have a little bit more to be able to do. I probably wouldn't have to work.
So my short term goal would be 2000 a month. My long term goal would be about anywhere between five to 8,000 a month.
You're able to actually scale it up much quicker
So before you on average was 30
Are you willing to show up to the call fully focused with zero distractions, pen and notepad, ready to take some notes?
Where's that drive come from? Why is that important for you to get back to healthy?
It's not just about more making more money
Enough. I'm already making easy with my chick. We're making close to 20, but
That just sounds like a good number
Cause I'd like to have enough money too to feel like if opportunities come up I can invest in it
And so your goal is 20,000 a month in passive income
Yes, I actually made 76 last year. I don't know what I made this year.
Gotcha. Yeah, it sounds like you're someone that wants to leave behind some sort of legacy <affirmative>.
Thomas. Thomas. Thank you so much, Thomas. I appreciate this call, man.
Excellent. Thank you so much. It's same number, right?
I'll have to just tell my wife that we have plans to be at home
Okay. How does Thursday look for you?
I mean, whatever's positive, cash flow whatever income I can, If it's 5,000 a month, 10,000 a month, that would be great.
And then your first name is Sam, correct? Last name Paez,
Yeah, that's what I'm looking to do. Yeah.
They're starting to do this Airbnb stuff
Cause that's sounds like something Evangel always wanted to do
Catherine. And who is Catherine again?
Right now, from this year alone, my bills are what, 66 and I still have prior that I'm still trying to clear up all <affirmative>
Yeah, about that. We're about 70 cents to your dollar. But still, how much did you say those guys are getting? 16 grand
Stefan. Hey, it's Cooper with BNB Formula. I'm Brian Page's team. How you doing?
So diversification I guess is what I'm after
But yeah, no, I haven't done anything like that or at least pursued it
And between the day to day stuff with Airbnb and your full-time job, how much are you working per day?
About a hundred and something thousand dollars around there.
To be, I'm sorry, say that again?
One last important thing and then we're gonna hop off
I'm all the way up by Canada
Some people love to continue to work and wanna work for a long time and some people really want to retire early
That's something like, cause I talk to students all day long essentially
We could conversate about things lot better
Great. And for that book is CJ Son, 77 Hotmail. Best email address for you?
Well right now I'm a hair stylist, but I wanted that as a second. Income.
And that's a 10 x roi, right?
Okay, gotcha. Understood. And what else? Obviously lifestyle house and car, but I mean what's kind of the ultimate goal there?
Well Douglas you're confirmed with Mr
It would just put a massive smile on my face and honestly, it's like the best part of my job here
Call? A call. Cause 10 I say for the phone
Cool. By the way, if that does happen we just charge to the card that we have on file back from when you got the book.
All right, man. Have a nice day.
It's got a confirmation on that so you're confirmed to go
You will. Todd, Just a couple men, you'll just a couple mental shifts away.
And so it looks like we got you in with Miss Catherine Funk which is great, man
<laugh>. Yeah, rents are sky high around here
A 4:00 PM is Okay, that works.
I have a hop on a call in another few minutes, but a few more things before we wrap it up
23. Exactly. I in I'm I'm in Phoenix.
Sure. I'm completely disconnected from the educational materials. How would I get reconnected with the chorus?
Yeah, I know who Brian Page is. I follow his work. He does good. Some good stuff. I not,
What do you think they'll make off of that? Just that one property a month?
Well I wouldn't have to go to my job from eight to five
And here I am normally really good at you normally don't lose things
She's probably off, but she just sent out within the next 24 hours or so
Sure. Awesome. And why hundred K?
It can teach you a couple really cool things in there just to make sure you can take full advantage of the 60 minutes
Well, of course I'd keep it going
I think that should be fine. 6:00 PM would be best.
I'll send that to you right after this, as well as a calendar invite
So definitely had to get the book
Okay. And you said this is with Don? Who?
Awesome. So Manny, what's your credit score?
So in that case what I have available for tomorrow, and just wait for this to load real quick
So sounds like it sounds security, financial security is a big one for you.
I got nine o'clock and I'll be done
You too, Johnny. And hey man, appreciate the time and I'm looking forward to hearing how it goes for you.
If you could just choose how much you wanted to make per month, few years from now, what would that number be?
That's right. Am I Alana Dale at Harmony Property Investments? That's not you.
These guys are usually collecting 2000 bucks for a slot
Well what it sounds like, it sounds maybe this isn't the best isn't the fit
Okay. Okay. All right. I'll look forward to hearing back from you guys then. Okay.
I owned a duplex and I don't have that no more
And Tokyo, Japan's the biggest city in the world, so that's like a musty,
So for you man, ideally in a perfect world, what's the ideal monthly income you'd be hoping to get out of an Airbnb business?
Like I said, I've been through it
Financial situations do a whole lot
So not to cut you off, but I know you said freedom
It's just to make sure that people are able to show up to deployments and we protect our consultants' time as well
Well we have one little girl and another one coming here soon
From Arizona? It will likely be from Arizona
The weather, there's all good all year round
Awesome. And let's go to your west and@nohome.com email address.
You don't have to come out of pocket 50, 60, a hundred grand to purchase a property
And then you subtract the rent from that
Yeah, we can do that. It's just a form for the lease.
Would you feel more comfortable cause don't have to do it over the phone? I can understand that
If I take the time to email that to you right after this, will you watch it before you speak to him?
So he could be a potential person you could do some of these deals with
No if that does happen, we'll just chart it to the card that we have on file back when you got the book.
We're still totally losing money, we're just trying to recoup a little bit
It sounds like providing financial stability for your family is really important to you
It's exhausting always having to figure it out
Well, maybe it's a good thing that you did,
Gotcha. And for the last two years did you make below $40,000 last two years?
So that's all pie in the sky to me
So <laugh>, it must be something, this must be God given
Where do you feel like you're at right now?
<affirmative>, I'll email it and text it so you have it and I'll send you a calendar invite.
Stratton needs for you for your guys to call later today
Tomorrow I have a 1230 and a three 30
I mean ideally every day, how much free time would you wanna be having?
Oh, lemme look at my calendar. Just make sure I don't have anything.
I like to challenge myself, I guess
<affirmative>, how much you bringing home each month in cash from that property?
One is 2100 and then the other one is 500.
All in. Are you working right now?
Yep. Okay, cool. Now I've got kb ain't no joke@icloud.com. Do you want me to update that or is that the best email for you?
Now I actually get a look at the calendars first, but how does all that sound?
Brian Page asked me to give you a call to see how you were doing on your Airbnb journey so far
Always trying to You don't think the $7 a gallon is crazy <laugh>? You don't think that's the right path?
Awesome. And the best phone number for the executive consultant to call you on is one we're on right now.
I'm like, is this an actual person with, We'll find out majority of the time
So let's go ahead and actually though, I think I'd want my husband to listen in on it as well
Let's do Monday at 4:00 PM
They're the ones that typically have the most success with this
Wow, so a few wrenches were thrown in your way
And so for you, obviously the motivation is $40,000 a month would probably change things for you
Tell me what time zone you're in
They typically worked two to three hours a week calling around cutting deals with landlords, going in stages of property, just spacing that out
Yeah, literally one of the best. Oh,
So when you do leave and you go back home, everything's running so smoothly
Tomorrow would be a little tight
Just like they said, the flipping houses stuff
I think this coming Monday may be a little tough
Okay, so how do, I know you're really with Brian and all that, but you said look my stuff up mine.
Ma. I hope so. So far I've enjoyed our conversation. I appreciate it.
Okay. Yeah, just go ahead, add to Google.
On our team, we actually have full-time executive consultants who are a lot more equipped to get new results than I am
<affirmative>? Like 12 minutes or so?
Yeah, well I, I actually have a few questions I can ask to get some context for the executive consultant
If I'm not adding value to them, then it would make sense if they find a better place to do that for them
I just do that just if I need some extra cash I can ramp up the number that I do
They're old, they're getting old but they're still healthy, thankfully, all that good stuff
So I just wanna make sure you can a hundred percent make 11:00 AM pacific time tomorrow
So our executive consultant has the context that he needs to help figure out what are the kind of leases you can get
I love that man. Why 50,000?
They work directly with Brian Page himself and regularly get paid $2,000 for just a single hour of consulting
We've actually got full-time executive consultants who are a lot more equipped at actually getting you results and getting you started than I am
And just to double confirm before you, I'll lock you guys in there for that seven o'clock
Hear you. Is now a terrible time to talk?
A solid amount of passive income bringing home each year from Airbnb
Yeah, a little bit I guess.
Cool. Now I gotta take a look at the calendar first, but that sound
Cause as long as the money's worth it
That. I've got a new dog and she doesn't, doesn't let me sleep in
I'm put you on mute again
Have you ever been to Tulum?
<laugh> count. Ah, okay. That makes sense. And then the email I have for you is S BF G P gmail?
And you obviously want to get to a place where you can ultimately retire early and maybe even get up to $10,000 a month
Yeah, do you have an iPhone right now?
All right, have a go on then. Bye.
Yeah. Let me just make sure I have everything correct. So obviously I have your phone number and then I've got alan gmail.com.
So I mean you could just see how you could definitely grow
They've got to do with how the student and specific mental models they operate with towards the Airbnb business
And then I've got JTB 2 22 lehigh
So I mean just stacking money and investments just for the sake of it is kind of pointless
So all of which have personally done six or even seven figures with their personal Airbnb businesses
<affirmative>. Gotcha. And do you have a specific goal in mind of how much you'd like to make with Airbnb?
And one last thing, I'm just gonna send over that calendar invite to your email is sterling burris gmail
How close are you getting that goal?
And so I go for it
And so here's what I'm gonna do for you man
I have 10 Airbnb properties and I don't need any help
I know I'm harping on it super hard
All right. Thank you. Appreciate it, Thomas. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.
The way this works, super simple
If just making that switch, there's a significant financial upside from doing so
So is this number that we're talking about right now the best number for you guys to talk on Monday?
So, I mean, where I'm at is Hold on, stop it
That's something I'd be interested in
6:00 AM If I have to get up at 6:00 AM I can do that.
Okay. I can do a 12, 12 30, 1 30, 12 30
And I mean when I say 80, I mean I'm outside of actually being at work or being at appointments
I like the way you're thinking
So it's not always gonna be you're dive in with both feet immediately and leave everything else to rest
No, I got everything on Airbnb and Virgo.
Yeah. Well that's awesome. What got you interested in Airbnbs in the first place?
Cuz the fact you're 19, I respect, Or you're 20 now you're 20
I haven't been back to tell you the truth in a while. I'm in Phoenix now.
<laugh>. No, I don't. There's very few, but I keep zero balances, I pay them off.
Yeah, <affirmative>, I can't imagine why I wouldn't
<crosstalk> just sent over a calendar
Just the fact that we didn't have any experience behind our belt
Okay. Thomas? Mm-hmm. <affirmative> Thomas what?
Yes. And what, is it going to be a phone call or are we talking about a Zoom call?
And then just so I know, cause I'm actually gonna put you with Mr
Haven't even started. All good, man. Life happens. Life happens. Yeah,
For the money that I currently have to buy more properties would probably be like in the 180 range.
So we'll probably be at a 60,000 with our social security and then with the business 2000 a month on that
Okay, lemme change this real quick
Hey Natalie. Hello. This is Thomas with Be from Bryan. Hey,
<laugh>? I dunno what this is leading, to be honest with you. No immediate plan, No.
So the host, the main house down
We can do it over the phone here
This is a little snow on the ground
Well, I want to do things that I want to do not, I want build my business, not somebody else's business.
Yeah. So how many people join the team? What's the conversion rate from getting your join the team and getting your first property?
Butlers confirmed for you and Joe, I have an awesome Y your day
No, I do that over the phone or through the b d website.
I'm guarding a Covid tent, making sure nobody messes with the generators and that power stays on so that the medicine stays good
Sweet. I'll see you later. Bye.
Okay. I remember I did P 90 X back in the day, but I don't know if I can do Tony anymore. <laugh>
So willing to take a chance with this
So that's something I need to work on
It's the one that teaches you how to start your own Airbnb business without owning any of your own property
I mean we've seen a guy that started Jerry's from Texas
Right, man. Yeah, good to know you. We'll talk to you soon.
Yeah. Which email address you sent it to
Okay. Do you know what your credit score is last time you checked?
Yeah, for sure. Yeah man, a hundred percent. I'm a boat. I love boating so I hear you.
But it would be something that does change, I look
Okay. When was the last time I had left my head was when we went to my mom's and I just grabbed the wallet.
They don't really like to allow people to do that
Yeah. I'm surprised. Wow. You wanna leave Austin? I hear so many good things.
Obviously you have intentions to, I can clearly see you have intentions to build passive income
And just a ballpark for you here Brian, but what's your current income? What are you making per year you think?
Yeah. Perfect. 1:00 PM Sounds good.
I might you catch me every now and then to give myself a extra $1,500 maybe
But then I have to generate more leads to support two more people
Oh hi. Good. How are you?
We still need to work on the checklist for the housekeeping and all that guidebook
Profitable the future, you know what I'm saying? So I did jump into it
Oh yeah man. One day at a time. Was it right now? Sure.
No, of course. Let's do it.
And so the thing that picked me is just that extra income
No I'm gonna be on the call.
And right now you said you're an electrical engineer and you've been doing that for a little bit under a year
And that's one thing I need to, which I'm not saying that it doesn't work
And so I'll send stuff right out of the call
Hence where I can say I can now move to Atlanta and still work for the company cause I'm working remotely
I mean it just depends mean I should be able to make the call mean unless something crazy comes up
Yeah, let's put a plan together
Definitely. What number would I be able to get to you at?
And could you just go ahead and accept that really quick, Joe, You there?
A concept. Do I seem a little
I'm building my own restaurant stuff right now, so I kind of slowed down the Airbnb side of things
And then obviously there's no pressure to do anything
And with me on lockdown for two weeks, I can't do shit
Hey, yeah. This is Cooper with BNB Formula. I'm on Brian Page's team. How you doing today?
So five 30 central time Friday, you guys are good for that
Even if it's in stocks or crypto right now
Was, Yeah, that's why I was hard on it
Right. You ain't gotta worry about that. I don't know. I ain't gonna miss that.
We're doing a averages like four five.
Now, obviously if that's the case, that would require higher level of investment
I'm just waiting for my computer to get all loaded up
You know what I mean? So that's what I'm in a crossroads right now
So you're totally there with what I can actually do for you is let's just find a time here and then yeah,
No, my wife will still be at work, but my wife doesn't speak a lot of English. It's actually very Okay. Very little what she speaks.
So it's 10 49 for you?
I mean, I really don't have a lot, to be honest with you
So on our team, we've actually got full-time executive consultants
I know you will, I know you will
Well how much, what's the minimum? How much would you say you need
More of an attitude or just get on it kind of thing instead of take some action kind of deal is what you're saying or,
Course man. I love you have the mindset, man, and it sounds like you just need the how and you can freaking kill it with this.
You'll see two emails when you do open it up
Yeah. What city are you based out of?
I like to, because I'm still working so I like to replace that income. So I'd like to be getting 10,000 a month cash, at least
So let's see, looks like the time is available with Mr
Depends on right, That's the normal right? <affirmative>?
And it's crazy and is a red zone so it's got the worst regulations out of anywhere
Doing pretty good, man. Who's this?
Cause I have put myself in a better position
Just wanted to triple check just cuz we do have a policy to charge a hundred dollars cancellation or reschedule fee for these appointments
Cuz we know there's so much to learn on that first property
It looks like we have a few open double confirm here, maybe a few open actually tomorrow on Saturday central time
Okay. What time zone you in?
I'll get your phone number in here for them so they have that
I could probably do something in the, What are the East Coast or are they on our time?
I said that's a good thing. What can I do for you,
Okay. Yeah, I was just gonna ask, what would you get you to attend?
So if you can't show up to the call focus, you just randomly nohow or cancel something
And the reason why we have that policy in place is it's like obviously we want to protect our executive consultants time
I'll text you after this so you have my number
They're far more equipped at actually getting you results, getting you started than I would be
But I haven't finished the whole book and honestly I could finish it in 15, 20 minutes
Gotcha. And how much capital do you have available to put into deposits on leases for these Airbnb properties?
I hated that feeling because it was never, I was grateful for it but I was never satisfied with it
Well, I mean to start a nice 10 grand a month would be nice to get started
Yeah, yeah, no, I just wanna make sure just so I can look out for the number.
I'm just trying to pinpoint how, how's the gig work, if you don't mind me asking for you to make some money
Ge. That's awesome. That's so cool. What's the name of LLC
Typically it is thousand dollars slot
So do you mind helping me fill that out real quick? It's just three questions here
Hello Casey, can you hear me? Casey, this is Cooper with, This is Cooper with Bmb formula Mom, Brian Page's team
Do you want me to share it? I think I have a super solid idea of how we can help you.
No I mean I kind of glad you called. It's real <laugh>, I mean interest is there. And what was your name again? Ty? I missed
Me. Eight. Okay, I was gonna say seven 30
Well, I could make something work, I think. I mean, I'm gonna say five grand.
No, it shouldn't be a problem unless flight gets canceled or some, which hopefully won't happen, but even then probably I'd be
And if you could hit 30, 60 K, that's that that'd be solid
Perfect. I'll make it happen. I'll lock it in here and you'll be good to go.
Well, okay, let me give you the story
Oh, you sound like a very, I say this honestly you sound like a very organized and planned out person so
I didn't get all the way through it
Just wanted to double check there
I gotta take a look at the calendar first, but how's that sound?
Yeah, I would be intrigued to, I guess hear what they have to say
All right, later man. Take care.
It is later in the evening
Only reason I ask is the video is just super important
It's just abused and text messages are getting to be stupid nowadays too
Oh, boot camp. That's awesome man.
Oh, today is usually pretty busy, but I guess tomorrow would work better at four. Might work
Well, the reason I'm calling is I'm actually the manager of our student success team here for Brian
How do you feel like having an Airbnb business will help you get you an eight?
Cash, man, I only need six, seven properties to go
Okay, gotcha. Yeah, just look into pocket $1,500 out the gate.
I mean, they're light years ahead of me
It's a business, just something that will bring extra income besides just learning the planet
So it looks like, let's see, so 9:00 AM on Saturday Pacific, it looks like that's available with Mr
Okay. Yeah, I understand. Yeah, <affirmative>. And so as far as your other job goes, you're working, how much are you working now?
So really in reality it's free
So once I get this property, get on the market, then I'll be working with about $80,000
And are you working a lot right now with your current job?
And what time is this? It's nine o'clock or 10 o'clock? Nine o'clock
So yeah, it all takes time
Okay. All right. Okay. I'll got it written down then. 9:00 AM Airbnb. All right. And yep, on the 14th. Okay.
Cause the last renter, they had so much junk
I'm sorry, I'm doing so much at one time
I'm a supervisor for the Department of Veteran Affairs and Human Resources. So it's really a trying time with C and would've been a health organization.
Well now, I mean there's tons of ways to get creative with funding and all sorts of things and we can get to that
But yeah, this is definitely interesting
Oh dude, I'm gonna hold you to that man. I'm gonna hold you to
I paid a lot of money and <laugh>, I mean I was cut off after the first webinar seminar or whatever it was
I am. I'll send you a calendar invite as well as an email right after we get off the phone.
All right, well thanks for checking up. It's always in the back of my mind. I take the
I just didn't know if it was different for you
Yeah. Why are they I mean you said you're in the military, which understandable. Yeah. Yeah. How are you guys restricted from your jobs?
I think that's it, man. Like I said, I
And why 10,000 a month specifically?
Not so good. I've been in the hospital, I haven't been able to do anything. It's been a really bad few years for me.
Feel free to pull up your, your calendar or take a look also if you want
And what does normal mean to you?
So these guys are some of the best in the world at what they do
Like you can be focused to sit down with a pen and paper ready to take notes and learn a couple things
When leasing properties that you might be putting on Airbnb, going out to secure homes, that sort of thing
I mean 70 K off it
And you don't see them as much as ideally you'd want to right now you have to travel to get there
But man, I'm actually surprised that you said that completely
So if this happens or I need to have a backup plan, <laugh>
Circled? N but it's spelled with it E Circle
And we're on the same wavelength and we're on the same goals and working second collaborate, I mean enjoy partnerships
I work for a company, a grocery company in San Antonio, heb or in Texas.
And then you reinvested again and then you reinvested again
So you know, obviously can't expect that
Yeah, I mean something that a lot of people deal with, people working full-time jobs doing two to three jobs
So on Friday I have a five o'clock in the afternoon on Saturday I have 7:00 AM I have 5:00 PM
All right, Casey. Well you have a great rest of your weekend, okay?
Okay, cool. Awesome. Sounds good. So a hundred percent there. You'll be good to go for five o'clock eastern next week on Friday.
Cuz when, and my friends, we pretty much got one as a group
Okay. Do you know what your credit score is at?
If you're netting nine grand a month with no expenses, you
Okay. Do you want me to break kind of down how that go would go if I can find some availability in the calendar?
I create Airbnb, business, Airbnb, Basical, I, I, Airbnb, <crosstalk> income, create passive income.
Okay, awesome. Well I'll send you the information and I'll send you a calendar invite.
So looking to get your wife retired and get you out of your job
So if you want to call him up and just see if,
Okay. Let's do this. I will prefer my partner but I have to actually check out his schedule.
Gotcha. And then after expenses and bills and stuff like that mean, what would you be using the extra cash for?
I mean I have some business sense
Okay, gotcha. I also have a five o'clock later today. I don't know if you'd be able to make that work.
So obviously we don't wanna waste your time
It take 30 seconds to send over
Squeaky clean. S Q U E A K Y C L E A n? Yeah. Of the valley gmail.com
It's like, well of course it doesn't, didn't really get it the full information, so that's why
Yeah, it's scheduled Friday, December 3rd, three or 3:00 PM
Sure. Yeah, I can fit that in, yeah.
The reason that I'm calling you is actually, so I'm the manager of our student success team here for Brian
Yeah, I did, I did. I ordered one. I never received it, so do that. I appreciate it here.
So would you be able to do that?
I just chose a career that I saw I guess growing up
And you don't know what that thing is yet.
But as of right now, it's probably, it's gonna be me
Well you're in a great position to start, honestly
You see link there? Add to your calendar?
And ideally then I'd have someone else running and dealing with all the behind the scenes
So I'll go ahead and send that over
I don't know. It depends on how well steward my money. Maybe you a few years,
Either way though, you're gonna have an update from me
Now I gotta take a look at the calendar first, but how does that sound?
I work a full-time job right now
Wow, that's amazing man. That's amazing. How much do you need in terms of capital to actually be able to create that?
So plus at the end of the call, they do feel like you're good enough fit
And that's within the first three months
You want me to break down that call? Kind of what you could expect if I can find some availability in the calendar here,
And then we're gonna turn, it's got some plans to make some extra room to make it
Awesome. So do you mind helping me fill that out really quick? Just a few questions.
Is that something you'd wanna do?
Well, I mean if I could get rid of replace my rental income or something like that, I think it'd be a lot better <laugh>
Only reason I ask is the video is just super important
It is a requirement for you to watch it prior
You're aware of income, you have the life insurance policy and you got a ADK in capital you could potentially put into properties
I feel like that I really am interested in the tour and decorating houses and then I have the customer service side
Well, that's what I'm trying to do right there.
Just cause I wouldn't wanna get you all hyped up and excited
I'd rather not reveal that right now
Stratton does make sure that everyone that I place on his calendar watches an important pre-call video beforehand
A hundred percent man. I hope you do, man. Dude, right?
The i o eight banking score, ico
If you recall, you got Brian's book a few weeks ago on how to become financially independent with Airbnbs
It was usually six five of the day a job
<affirmative>? Yeah, I'll send over a counter invitation to get you in
Well I think you should be good to go, man
Right man, I just sent you a text
Do you want me to just share it?
<laugh>, hey I got that this, I loved it
There's a tons of different things
But first, if that sounds like something you want to do, let me break down how that would go so you have an idea
Yes, but she she'll be available on that on Monday.
And then second to last thing here
That would be a lot better
Right now I'm owner operator and I want to not be operator
All right, no problem. Take care.
I'm going, How do you like that <laugh>? Yeah, she doesn't like it
So I'm curious of what got you interested in Airbnb in the first place?
With them 40 hours a month they they bring in 3000
It's come from having absolutely nothing for 30 years.
So I'm sending this text to you right now of all the times that are available tomorrow
Yeah. Yeah. Fair enough. Okay. I'm not
So I'm still learning things every new things every day
Let's just be straight up with each other
I don't know enough about it
I don't have any doubts that it's gonna fail
It's just if we find ourselves kind of falling back, we're stepping too far back
Okay let's see from what time zone you in?
So would there be any point you could squeeze in an hour?
That's just if you're not able to show up to the call focus, you just randomly cancel or blatantly no-show something like that
And you said you're starting a new job
And yeah, man, sometimes you just need a little bit of a nudge. You just need a little bit of a tap on the shoulder sometimes.
Yes, I could do Sunday. Sunday. I can take a phone call from all day. I can set myself aside and actually get that going.
I mean, do you have anything that you're working with right now? Any investments or crypto or anything in the checking? Okay, like
You do your taxes the last couple years?
And really what we found is that the vast majority of people never ended up getting started
Cause I talk to a lot of people with a lot of different goals and stuff like that
I feel like with four or five I'm perfectly happy
I mean, think about it this way
Plus for me it helps me figure out if there's ways I can help you
<laugh>, totally fine life. You have your job, you
How, I mean, how's that been affecting you?
You're chasing after it right now
First one is, what is your credit score right now?
I'll give you some time and I'll give you some resources so that you can get some better information
In passive income, almost entirely passive income
I just try to stay positive with whatever feedback they give me
But I, I'm certain that I spent another $6,000 to get access to get everything
Just wouldn't wanna leave her out
You're motivated at a 10 though
I'm in San right now. I'm in Mountain Time and <inaudible> as we speak.
So we finally got our first property up in October
Here's things that get 'em into the bus
Average I make about 2000 a week
We're Phoenix, Scottsdale, that sort of area
So it's my understanding that Brian does do a sort of a group Q and a session for the coaching program occasionally
So it looks like there actually is a few spots open next week
Yeah, only reason I ask is it is just super important
Do you, You know what that is?
So it looks like that 5:00 PM Eastern time is available with one of our consultants, Mr
You requested that we touch base on Monday
Okay. Let ask you this, How long you think this might take?
So I wanted to reach out and see if you got your first property yet
I'm doing wonderful man. Just over here trying and change the world.
Understood. Yeah, I totally get you. So you're the only source of income that you have right now that's significant is your active income, right?
And just putting in the work and putting in the time
Is, What's a longer term? What's a longer term goal for you? Something higher. What would be nice? What would be really nice?
So he just gives me three to five minutes to check in with some folks
If you're not able to show up to the call focus, you just randomly cancel or nohow or something like that
Yeah. Appreciate it man. You said your name was
Profit. Yeah. I probably mean, I would say like 10 K.
And we have listings on Airbnb and well met Illinois
For today or for tomorrow? Yeah, that would be better. Okay. Cause I've got a meeting at five or six tonight.
At some point I'm gonna run out of if I run in too many different directions, I'm not gonna get anything accomplished
Renzi has everything he needs to figure out what's gonna be best
And the reason why we have that policy in place is just obviously we want to protect our executive consultants' time
Yeah, but I'm, I have 15 right now, but I don't want run dry cuz I'm a 10 99
Sharp, seven o'clock central standard time
We love to see that if that's what someone wants to do
And I did this all on the side
I planned on it and just never did
And it's just to protect against them having blank space on their calendars
All right, you too. Take evening. Bye.
I mean I have your email, your phone in here
And it's just to protect against them having blank space on their calendar
So five 30, let's say, let's just give you an hour
Well that's all the context that Mr
And I don't know how her schedule looks over the weekend, what her hours are working
Could you say it again? I'm sorry, <affirmative>.
I mean, man, look, if I could just pull some strings back here
Cause it's not like you freaking crush those at one property netted at 40, 50 k
Wanna help a lot of people and you feel like with $40,000 a month or growing another business you'd be able to help way more people?
So then I basically was pretty hands off and focused on my job at that point in time
But you are good to go for six Eastern, you and your husband both
I mean most people will sign a year lease if you wanted to negotiate
It gives you more than you need to know
Okay, cool. So what time zone do you and Christine
Okay. Yeah, of course. And so working at airport for five years, is that, that's something you're looking to move out of?
Yep. I'll email it to you and I'll also text it to you so you can watch it on your phone if you need to.
Hang on my calling me on a business on one second. Yep. All right. I just have say that again. So am I able calling?
I've got some demos to do with them. Do you think they're any good?
What's the ideal monthly income you're hoping to get to with your Airbnb business?
Rogers has the context that he needs to help you figure out what kind of leases you'd be able to get
And it is super important so that you can take the most value out of the call itself and just be properly prepared
I tried the rental deal and had the duplex and I wasn't getting as much getting us very far
If it made sense to me move ahead with this because having a mentor's gonna accelerate my success and get me there faster
I said there's awesome places everywhere
So they're all completely vetted and verified
So the first thing to look at when you're gonna get a lease typically is credit score and annual income
We'll lock you in for three o'clock today
I just had my daughter who was then she could qualify for Medicare
He's doing seven figures, his air Airbnb portfolio
I don't personally, but are there any hotels or ins basketball in that town?
And as a part of, so we're gonna get you with, luckily Mr
I got about $5,000, which is gonna disappear after all the expenses this month.
So I'm excited to see how it goes
That does come with a little bit more effort on the front end just to get things going
I have business up here as well
Yeah, no worries. Do you keep your credit on your banking app or do you use Experian or Credit Karma or something?
Like I said, please make sure to take some notes
Yeah, that's what I would like to get. 1500.
And I'm going try to pull some strings for you back here
Yeah, I would to do that every year. At least once a year going to Safari.
So that's actually a link from the calendar software we used
It looks like, okay, it looks like we were able to get you confirmed with Mr
It's just not gonna work for me
Would you mind helping me fill it out really quick?
Okay. And is that all checking, savings, crypto, what is that?
I could do that. I could do that.
It just takes a few minutes
No. Go and bring it down to me.
I want freedom time and I wanna free up my time
All right, Todd. Good talking to you.
Right now it's in between six 17 and 6 25
Would, I'd probably be a lot more comfortable with that 200,000 thousand for a year, a month
But I mean that would be enough for me cuz it's just me
Yeah, I mean it's got me interested now again to take a look at it again and just see what could be done
Rob Smith needs to figure out what's best for you guys
You, you'd kind of be set
And so it sounds like you're running a lot of these businesses
Okay. And is that all of it between you guys, like checking savings
Just seeing how hard my parents work for me and just my siblings to get us there
Wow. So you said you've already made about two grand the room that you're renting out right now or the place for engine out?
And my focus I struggle with like ADHD for some time and I'm just now getting a handle on it
Afternoon is always good. But yeah, let's do something. Wait Wednesday. Hello? I got tomorrow nine 30. Hold on, let me think. What do I have?
Yeah, we'll watch it here in about 30 minutes.
The call is free and then they're gonna pitch me other sales.
Well, I went bankrupt in July of 2019, so it's hard to say
We got you in for Tuesday
Okay. I lock it in at 10, man. <laugh>, I Right.
Okay. Well is that important to,
Oh, probably not. I would probably keep it going cuz what else am I gonna do?
Yeah, unlimited. That that's a nice number. <laugh>.
I had pretty much booked but I said again now I didn't make a hundred percent 70 K because it was my property
So do you know what your credit score is?
Yeah, so you know, shoot, people get into Airbnb
So I was really happy with that
So that's where I'm at right now
I can feel it in the energy out there
Does that ring a bell? Yes
So that'd be a pretty good day
All right, cool. So for the card you're gonna use for the deposit, does it have a middle initial on it?
And we do have a policy to charge a hundred dollars cancellation or reschedule fee for these appointments
Now you're in a sticky situation
I have no doubt in my mind I cannot be successful doing it
So that's actually why I'm reaching out to you
The brand I own starters on my mind have a pretty good job right now
And so this is the number we use
I had a blood clot that almost killed me
Honestly, right now, I think the highest return on your time you could do is just get capital
I mean, on our team we've actually got full-time executive consultants who are a lot more equipped at get new results
Do you know what your credit score's at
Down there too. Nice down there too.
You caught a flight earlier today?
It's possible to offer it to you <affirmative>, but it's also likely they won't offer it to you as well
Smith and so you guys can get connected that way given that the counter invite's taken a little bit longer to load
So the last thing I'm required to do is just to fill out a little bit form here with three questions so that Mr
I'll go ahead and email that to you right after this
And it sounds like you'll have about a few minutes, so I'll make the rest of this quick
How much available capital do you have to put into leases on Airbnbs, whether it's in savings or 401ks or anything like that?
Cause once I have more knowledge about it, I'll figure I'll put down a plan for me specifically how I'm gonna work towards
Well, I'm sure he'll ask you a lot of questions about that in your guys' call, so you can give you good guidance
So the first thing to look at when you're going to get a lease is your credit score
Do you have any other questions for me?
So normally they charge like a thousand dollars an hour for their Airbnb consulting
Okay, so not too long ago
It's been such a blessing and yeah, I credit it
Oh, Cooper. All right. Cooper, I think I did speak with you one time and I just joined. I think I did. Yeah. <affirmative>.
Again, depends on how much I have to invest it too
So you are confirmed and trics, Mr
It's really for one of two main reasons
We require a hundred dollars fully refundable deposit and we essentially refund it if you show up
Okay, I hear you loud and clear. It's a free call though, right?
How many properties would I need to be at six figures and above? Oh, monthly, I'm so sorry, but not monthly
Okay, so total ballpark of just what's liquid or could be liquid soon, what are you
Okay, I can definitely look into that
What would you say is the biggest obstacle, would you, The biggest obstacle Hold me back from achieving that goal
That's something I I'm gonna have to do
Okay, so it looks like what you scheduled in, excuse the noise in the background
And then you're on lead gen. So I mean how much hours a week do you want to be working ideally?
I would just live like part-time here and part-time in Jamaica or down in somewhere like Costa Rica or something like that
Can you say that again? I'm sorry. Someone was trying to talk to me. Say that again please. Oh
So if you're saying that it's five to six hours of work, that's cool
<laugh> maybe I didn't word that in the best way
Yeah, I don't wanna, Yeah, a hundred percent, a hundred percent
What's your credit score at right now?
So my goal is to have five properties under contract by the middle of next year
Benal does ask anyone I'd schedule on his calendar, watches a pre-call video like 12 minutes long
I mean that is that kind of business owner mentality, putting your money to work and reinvesting <affirmative>
Okay. Let me go back here and see
I can't hear you. Could you repeat that?
Are you facing any challenges or any struggles with that or any things that, how's that going for you right now?
And really their goal as consultants is to service the skip button for you
Yeah, hers is I think is 6 21.
I'm sorry, just actually break that down for me. Again, it's a requirement for what? Say that again.
Those are different paths to get there and different ways of thinking about it
Get 'em with teens and kids and that right there you can have anywhere from eight to 10 kids and one home
But there's absolutely no I, no commitment needed
That might be tough beforehand to 30 minutes
And then just to wrap it up here for Mr
Stock market, invest more times or do other things
Yeah. What high school did you go to?
What's the ideal monthly income you'd be hoping to get to with Airbnb?
I mean your lifestyle would change a little bit
I'm not sure. Similar, maybe half of that.
Won't be there, but I'm not gonna I don't want you to do that, so.
I just don't know how I would go about it in New York with all the Airbnb rules
Would you be opposed to 50,000 a month?
I would like to get it to where at some point I don't have to work out of town all the time
I mean just hear me out
And I, I'd honestly hate free to have to pay that
What's it Tuesday? One 30. That's cool.
And generational wealth, Just more streams of income
What would you do with some of that extra income coming in or that extra time that awarded you?
Plus, on top of that I have a marketing agency
And you don't have to make any commitments, anything like that
So I just wanted to be fully transparent with you and make sure that you could make it
We are, yep. All over the place.
I doing the summer was like five not five
I wanted to reach out to you and see how you're doing so far with Airbnbs
Yeah, you can go ahead and save
Do you have a ballpark estimate in the range?
No, I'd be interested in that for sure.
You have the attitude and you have the right information, you'll crush it man how long it takes
It's a different set of team skills and a different set of systems
Only reason I ask is it is super important you'd get a ton of value out of it
And again, that would result in that a hundred dollars cancellation fee and I'd hate for you to ever have to pay that
What are you working with now
At least, I mean, I wouldn't wanna, don't know
He, he's got about 30 units
I know it. I about six 30 rehab, she got do rehab books. No, 20 grand. Grand.
So first is it cool if I just ask you a couple questions here to see what you might need?
So basically what they can do is fill some questions, give you more information, but also dive deeper into exactly where you are with everything
But our executive consultants are really the expert on the how, right? On the way as you're talking about
So it seems like you're deciding between group home and Airbnb kind of weighing the risk, weighing how much you can make from it
Give me one second. Connecting to the internet won't be, won't take me too long. What's you rather do for the Navy?
So where would you hope to get to if you put the pedal to the metal a little bit after that?
Extraordinarily negative guy who only sees the negative and everything for some reason. <laugh>,
Well that is all the context that Miss Funk needs to figure out what's best you
Cause I did have, I think six debts
So that's basically what I'm gonna do, but
No, I don't get set up my alarm for one half perfect hour beforehand
Yeah, I'm gonna be working all week, man. So I mean I work six weeks on and then one week off.
I have a little car rental service so I'd probably buy more cars to boost my income that way too
Yes, I definitely have been, like I said, in intrigued, very intrigued to do it
Cause it sounds like this could be something that's truly impactful for you and for your family and for your kids
Yeah, that would be tremendous. Well gotta focus on the right things, I guess.
I'm actually, I'm curious cause what, I have a little bit of college loans that I'm paying off as well
All right, thanks. I look forward to talking to him tomorrow morning. I do. Thank you. So he's calling me, Is that what's going on?
I'm fantastic. Changing a couple lives today. Feeling good about it.
We usually pay double what you're charging
He's got 14 properties at this point
So we're kind of all over the place here
It'll give you a lot more information and clarity
But then your parents were like, Hey, Sophia, you gotta go do it
That's, it's a solid starting point for a lot of our students at that point
You all right, Jack? Sounds good. I will go ahead and lock it in.
Cause there's always ups and downs to everything
Okay, fair enough. So when are you guys moving to Florida? Summertime
I'm looking for something a little smaller, just not a home to start off or not a big home start off subleasing
Delivery now, because you're kind of new.
Yeah. So Joe, now that you're retired what are you looking to bring home in past VI income with Airbnb? Say per year?
Yeah, I'd be willing to speak with somebody.
So I would say without my commission it would be a little over 35,000 probably I would say 37 just to ballpark it
<affirmative>. And so your main question is like, well how does that actually work?
So if you could just go through there, maybe take some notes, chat down a couple questions
I feel like money brings you everything
He teaches a lot of people how to do this and become financially free
I'd do it a lot faster
And so what are you bringing home each year in annual income?
And then you should be good to go man
Oh, I don't know. I'd say seven something. It was good enough for the mortgage people.
Right now we're probably on a good month, maybe 5,000 and then on a bad month but only a thousand.
So especially with how I know myself and I'm not one to give up on something or be lazy with something I'm passionate about
And I mean, they can lay out exactly what needs to happen in order for you to get results
<laugh>. I'm glad you made distinct
I'm not exactly sure. I can check, but I'm not sure.
And with that being said, please be sure to do whatever you need to do to remind yourself during the call cuz he's busy
Then now you're in a good place to start
Yeah, it kind of depends on how my side business does
I will go ahead and lock it in and let You're gonna be with Mr
Let's do the one o'clock cuz he might and he might be napping
Sorry, I'm talking to my husband asking him if you see my wallet's
Sure. I'll be there. Trust me.
Now I gotta take a look at the calendar first, but how's that sound?
That's kind of my thing is seeing people
Well, I didn't lose it, but my business closed
You want me to fill it out?
And then usually the second thing they look at is your annual verifiable income
You remember the guy that shot his girlfriend in South Africa? Remember that guy with the, he was the blade runner
Currently I'm unemployed. I'm in between getting a job. There's been some personal stuff that's been going on.
It don't, don't really matter man
I to, I'd need to make what I'm making with both jobs right now and try to tone that back to one
Stratton needs to figure out what might be best for you
Yeah. Just so that he's fully aware. Would there be anyone else involved in your Airbnb business? Like a spouse or a partner?
But they take your money, work with it and charge you to get money from
What's going on Thomas? What's going on Thomas?
Okay, cool. Would you wanna have her on the call too so she can ask questions and you guys can be on the same page together?
Okay. Okay, sounds good. So today
So just doing things where I can be home full time and that's what I'm trying to replace this job with
I'm actually a manager on the student success team here for Brian
I mean cuz she gets off at five so it might be better to get her involved at five,
That's what people are saying now, man
You have that something called dynamic pricing
Okay. And what time zone are you in?
So we're actually building it out
I'll email that to you right after this, but will we be able to watch that before you speak Monday?
Bridger Rogers is his name. Roger's last name.
Tomorrow. During the day I'm pretty open in the evening I got two buildings to clean. Okay. And that's normally after six.
A 8:00 AM to time? Between 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM
You can put 'em out and just so people that Brent can enjoy themselves
So I come home today, then I'm off next week and I'm out the following week
Yeah, for sure. Would anything change for you personally if you got to that level?
Right now it is 10 39.
So hopefully by that time we're set enough or the business has taken off enough to where when he retires there's really no impact
Let's go. Whatever you need, come on.
Okay, got it. Aja Kit. How do you say your last name?
Okay. So you know were saying credit and income, that's a big part of it. And so what's your credit score at right now?
I mean I don't think we'd stop
That was on my high end <affirmative>
Okay, good. I be on the same page on that. It's cool, but I plan on making it
Dustin? It's Cooper with Bmb Formula. I'm Brian Page's team. How you doing?
Get started now. Is that it? Get started
Dude, Tony's a 10. Hest 10. He kicked your butt man that hour.
It's just something we have you
Well I'm in New Jersey right now, so that's Eastern standard.
It looks like you got his book a while back on starting an Airbnb business
So Remy, keep in touch man, and I hope you have an awesome day
I'll go ahead and do that. Right now. Sending over May take 20, 30 seconds to actually get delivered to your inbox.
They are like, hey, since we pay for this training, you owe like six years
Why do you love it so much?
And I, I'd hate for you to ever have to pay that
Okay. And then how much available capital do you have or have access to put in? Potential deposits on properties, purchase furniture, that sort of thing.
You should get two emails from them
So on Wednesday you have 10 or 11 open
I don't know if you remember or not, but it says you got Brian's book a while back on starting an Airbnb business
Okay, sounds good. We'll do that. And you're, you're gonna clear that so you can clear that four 30, so that's totally good to go.
I wanna set her up for success
Wi I'm gonna go ahead and confirm that time slot for you right now
Tomorrow? I'm watching children I think is the deal for me. So nothing besides that. I'm at home and I'm good.
So on our team we have full-time executive consultants
If you just got one new property every 45 days you'd be at $16,000 a month
Oh yeah. How much of that is checking account or crypto or what is that comprised of? The 30 K
I mean people still gotta visit family
If I take the time to email that to you right after this, will you watch it before we speak with him?
And that's just really what it's for is if you just, it is a disrespectful blatant nohow
So the folks who were really just doing the bare minimum but still having success
But maybe there's a life to create if you could
No, I can do it without it, but I mean, I definitely wanna be, it's gonna make it even more comfortable
She set up a profile or whatever, but I don't know
I really wanted to start a business, like something so I can have a past income, but I was not able to start anything.
Lancer know that you are fully committed to watching that video and you'll be ready to rock No distractions at 7:00 AM
Okay, gotcha. Yeah. And that, you know what, that's normal man. So congratulations. You're normal in a good way, obviously
Benino, he's our top executive consultant
I'm eastern time. Eastern. Eastern. Where are you calling from?
I've been in it for 20 years, so I'm looking to do a little bit more independent work, if you feel
You can just send me a text after your call, man
We're just kinda like look together and talk about everything
On our team, we actually have full-time executive consultants who are a lot more equipped at getting you results than I am
Now, what's kind of the next goal? The next stepping stone? Are you looking like 20 K a month? 50 K a month?
So I say maybe about 24, something like that
Do you feel like that's where you're at right now?
Okay. And then prior to that company, were you employed or was it another year of self-employment taxes that you submitted?
Well the reason I'm calling you is I'm a manager on our student success team here for Brian
I just know I put my head down and do it
I just was giving you a call back here
You do think it would be valuable for you or
Could you watch that video actually after we hop off this call?
You're in a very cool position doing what you do and so I'm excited to see what Mr
And then as a part of Mr
So I'm curious, other than that first property, it sounded like you got that right away
So I just wanna be fully transparent with you and really make sure that you could make that okay
So I'm not generating cash flow on the property right now
Yeah, my credit score has been kind of bouncing around a little bit lately
Oh you gotta be kidding me
It would be unbelievably just incredible.
Yeah. Can we push it a later in the week? Monday is mon, yeah, those times aren't gonna that won't work on a Monday.
Great. So I'm gonna send over a calendar invite to you really quick@mickyfivegmail.com.
Would you like me to share it?
Yeah, so I'm calling you because I saw you got Brian Page's book on how to create financial independence with Airbnbs two months ago
They spent hours mastering all the frameworks that are most successful seven figure Airbnb students use
No, no, no, no, no. Let's do this. Let's do first, First place.
See, my thing is, right now I think I have my own store business
They're like, heck, I'm just gonna go move to Asia
Would you be able to give that a peek?
Anything else you let me know
Okay. I see a couple of these going, gave me the yes no maybe option
We're kind of almost on the same page here in terms of where we're at in the journey
And I've on the family be the person who makes it happen
Do you know what your credit score is at?
And then everything beyond that, you guys split at a 2080 split, 40, 60, whatever it is that you negotiate
2:00 PM Eastern tomorrow you'll be speaking with Miss Catherine Funk
I know I'm harping on it hard man
For friend to come to say hi
Like dude, if you go out and close two $5,000 deals within the next week, you're there
A student success manager? Cause our customers Well, but yeah. Yeah.
I mean, that's how we would do
Stratton he does ask that I have him watch a 10, 12 minute video beforehand, just cuz you haven't gone through the course yet
Because it's a good income? Look, I'd like to get into this
<affirmative>, do you want me to share it?
Not specifically. Okay. Yeah, I've thought about it sometimes. Sorry.
It would just be not having to worry about money at that point
So the only other thing there is that I just want to fill out a couple things here
Again, like I said, it's probably comes back to how I was raised
So I'm gonna go ahead and send over a calendar invite to email right now. Could you just accept it really fast?
Okay. And then what's your current gross income at for the year, the number you'd be putting on your tax return?
I wouldn't need her permission to start something like that
Yeah, I've heard of that. Yeah. I don't know how well that would go
And the reason for that is there's over a million and a half new people that get on Airbnb every single week
And then within six months you're at four properties and you're at $6,000 a month
I opened up three Income Strategies of Successful People
I don't need the Rolls Royce right now and get it in the future
Yeah, not just sit there and do nothing
But then I'd go on to teach others and inspire others and obviously retire the parents <laugh>
And how long have you done that for
So I'm gonna take it as such
I'll do it before the end of the weekend then for sure. No matter what. All
I'm a hustler, coachable and teachable
What could be done from that point? <affirmative>
As a matter of fact, I talked to students every week, and we actually had a student who started with us 12 months ago
Well <laugh>, that was a nice opener there and well, Gavin does
How much debt do you have?
And everything was back to that audiobooks. Brian, something's wrong here. Ready to give you $1,700, but I guess I'm not supposed to right now. Okay.
Yeah, I thought maybe that's just something gonna help me for with cash and I would feel interested, passionate to do it
So in that email, Oh, the second one, Okay, May take a second
And he basically gives us a few minutes to reach out to our students and see there's any way we can help him
Brian Page wanted me to reach out and give you a call to see how you were doing on your Airbnb journey
I'm gonna send you a quick five minute video, give you more context around the Airbnb process page
So as long as you show up to deployment, you'll be fully refunded
So they probably be out of there in maybe about 40 minutes or so
I gotcha, I gotcha. Okay. Do you think that she'd be good to go for 11 and at the very least you would be?
I also own a couple of red routes and dabble a little bit in e-commerce, so
No. Yeah, I mean if we saw that, yeah, we wouldn't stop. I mean, I'm sure.
I'll email you this video literally in three minutes right after we get off the phone
And so that's really the purpose of this call
Would find So it would change your personal life cuz you would probably move, right?
And I'd hate for you to ever have to pay that
So I mean, Brian Page and our team, we have a lot of different resources and ways we help people
Okay, well I'll tell you what, Risa kinda give you some context
How do you feel like you wanna be able to give back?
I mean if you got that and lock that in, would you keep growing and keep climbing?
But we just like it's policy not even up to me, it's just policy
Ideal monthly? I don't even know, man
Obviously you've already got quite a few there but just so that Mr
I'll get working and I'll just let you do every day
And then just a few more quick things before we wrap it up here
I'm sorry, could you repeat that please?
But being a single father and then especially raising a daughter, that's hard
<laugh>. Fair deal. Okay, good. <laugh>.
And you kind of caught me in a pretty good spirit tonight
So I mean, what's kind of the ideal monthly income you're hoping to get to with Airbnb in general, even if you scale?
For? Oh, the people I've been working for, been for them for nine years and wow
April 5th, you put it in my calendar.
Okay. Also a ballpark here, but what is your current annual income?
Okay, sounds good brother. Thank you. Bye.
Appeal to, So you saying, okay, somebody that that's looking to make $3,000
I could in essence go up there and do that, but financially, I just don't know how to go about that
So for you, what's like that ideal monthly income you'd be looking to get out of an Airbnb business?
Do you remember getting his book while back on starting an Airbnb business?
These guys are a lot more equipped to get your results than I am
Yeah, so I'm in the beginning stages of it as well and going through it as well.
And that income is gonna be there
Cause I don't need endless money
So let's just get down to some numbers here
So that would also result in that a hundred dollars cancellation fee and I'd honestly hate for you to have to pay that
You wanna do me a favor and just try to pull that up and take a look at what you got going on tomorrow
Four o'clock. You got alarm in there?
You're welcome, Sean. Have a nice night man.
I don't remember actually, if I'm being honest
It'll gimme more peace of mind than 10,000
I know there's exceptions, but I'd be happy with that
Okay. And then what is your gross annual income at the number you might be putting on your tax returns? Either last year or this year?
So it could stack up pretty quickly and it doesn't require a ton of extra time to get going
You don't actually have to do any of the other stuff
But that's definitely hear or there
Just a quality of life, I guess being able to enjoy what you're doing
And then just let me know as soon as it goes through and you get the confirmation on your side.
Well, I'm responsible for, We got four kids now and my parents probably, I mean, I want to take care of them too
So I'm gonna send that over to you really quick and then if you could just one second here
I don't know any millionaires in my family
So I mean, in a perfect world, say you didn't have any boundaries
So do you know offhand just a ballpark number what your credit score is?
Oh, right, right, right. Yeah, I remember
Sorry. How long have you had the course for? How long have you had the course for?
But I know you just checked your schedule, so tomorrow four central shouldn't be an issue for you
Do you remember anything about that?
I do believe that mean one property, a good property can
I'm over a 10 because I've been struggling so much and just I need a change I need help
It's about 2000, 2002, something like that.
So you guys kind of work around that on the call, but you overall still get the strategy and the game plan you need
Anything? No, no. No consultation. No, no
So it's a whole lot easier now I think
Wow. My dad actually worked the clinical pathologist, clinical psychologist. I imagine how much intense, I imagine how much intense.
So basically what they can do is figure out exactly where you are right now with your Airbnb journey
Well that should be just about all the preliminary context Mr
And then one last thing here
Cause I know definitely my time would be free between one to four
And there's a hundred plus people who've done six figures
Just wanted to triple check on the timing and make sure that didn't conflict with anything because as time's super valuable
I do everything on Friday unless that's the only problem
How do you work your way up and whatever, What's the company called again that you work for?
Yeah, a hundred percent. And what are you doing now with your buying old strategy per month roughly?
Extended family or anything like that
Yeah, I B B Formula. Brian Page's team. You remember spending like a thousand dollars on his course while back?
I do see some serious opportunity in helping you
Right? I do. I have a four month old right next to me. Wow. Making all kinds of wages.
You, you're not able to a hundred percent commit to anything tomorrow or Friday, is that right
3 7 6 7 4 2 5 8 7 8 6 1 9.
So <affirmative> then I continue doing what I do
Like you said once, if you could build it up to get into the $20,000 a month level shit that'll get you there,
You're welcome man. Take it easy.
And then if you want to travel, if you wanna do this, if you wanna do that, the money's there
<laugh>, That would be impressive. That would be impressive. <laugh>.
Are you talking about the loophole with being a business and being a corporate housing and then listing on Airbnb?
Lancer needs to figure out what's best for you
So I understand that would mean the profits would come slower, but it also entails less risk
I got a lot invested right now, so I not I wish I had more to invest right now, but it depends
Well lemme say right now I make over $200,000 a year
Honestly, I, I'm, I'm really only mandated to working
Could you 12 by any chance?
Wow. Tell me more about that.
Hey Lorenzo, this is Thomas with B Formula
But I really, how to have I, Go ahead.
<affirmative>. Wow. It sounds like you've been through a lot and
It's L I don't look at that
Last year we went to Hawaii within a couple weeks notice
All right. What's your last name? Thomas
Miami. I'll be right down there with Grant Chilling.
I mean you wouldn't just stop there if it was working for
And so for you, it sounds like you travel with your family?
I don't, It's two Chinese. I don't know you can remember it. It's a leg
I think he said his actually asked him about this the other day
The bread routes, I don't do anything
Eastern. So it's 1151 for you right now.
Are you guys turning that into an Airbnb?
My credit from and then Experian is 7 21, I think.
But the meal plan though, that was hardcore man doing the meal plan on 90 x
Do you mind helping me fill that out real quick? Just a few questions here
Cause when I'm not on the road, I mean I'm at home, there's no office for me to go into
Problem. Do you want me to
I'm at 50 units 20 of 'em or so are the arbitrage model
To match what I'm making right now.
So I'm 52, I'll be 53 in a couple of months, and my husband and I would love to retire early
You know what I'm saying? I don't even call numbers that I don't know
I look forward to hearing how it goes
<laugh>. Gotcha. Yeah, for sure. That's awesome. You think she'd be proud of you if she could get her out there and help her out?
Now I'd have to look at their calendars first, but how does that sound?
And I said if I could get either one of 'em started, I'd probably end up dabbling a little bit with the other one
I mean, I'm up to a few hundred dollars passive, but I mean literally just started working all last month
Ideal income I was hoping to get to, What do you mean monthly, yearly, Weekly.
If not, I might be able to do something on Sunday. Actually,
Benno will call you at precisely 1130 Pacific time tomorrow
I'm trying to put it together
I would love to hear what they have you say for sure.
Not right now that they're booked up for the rest of the day, but
I was go back to the 30
Gotcha. Makes sense. So as far as cash or savings or whatever, is there anything there?
But what if I can do this for you since already a student you invested with us
I guess I can probably work something around it, but you know what I mean? I don't know
Perfect. Sounds good. Unique. Well hey, great. Getting to know you today and we're gonna get you set up.
I would say this week might not be good, so if it could be next week, that would probably be better.
Strand, he can definitely go way deeper on the call with you as well
Everything else for this, I'm ready to, for sake, everything else I got going on for this.
Yeah, no. I was supposed to go when the last time I went to Cancun but I didn't get a chance to go.
Yeah, we can do the four o'clock.
Okay, let me pull up the schedule real quick, see what we can do for you.
So you are at about a 6 89 credit score and an 82,000 annual income
Yeah. You were copping a spicy chicken sandwich. <affirmative>.
And if a way that I could personally destroy FedEx, please let me know
So when leasing properties that you'd be looking on Airbnb, you can look at a few different things that somewhere you get approved for
And as of now, where you're currently at, do you have any of those things to be able to leave behind?
Yeah, it does. No, it does. Okay. Yeah. R yeah.
Just your mind and your mouth can create a wonderful lifestyle
So if you can go full time with this dude, there's literally one woman I actually sending you her testimonial
I mean, I got a condo in Florida
So yeah, we can continue to learn and refine the process to where it's a well old machine
Will be really helpful in me getting you, getting you what you need and hooking you up here
Good. That was terrible. Time to, I didn't
And you're definitely gonna be the first person and you're definitely gonna be in the pre logue and everything
And in retirement, do you guys see yourself with all that extra time doing a bunch of different things that you're not doing now?
And so I'm really excited to see how this goes
I really know how to explain it
Does it sound like Right? Would you add anything to that? Yeah,
Only reason I ask is cuz the video is very important
Just loading here, but so three o'clock
They're light years ahead of me
Well you're good to go, my man for tomorrow
And then also what it can help me do is just go out and grow more and maybe eventually start buying properties
Gotcha. So you at about 700, let's say credit score and about 75 to 85 in annual income over the year?
Salvador, it's Cooper over on Brian Page's team. How you doing?
But I'd still wanna be involved in part of it in some aspects
So just going back to where we were in our conversation and first some context about me
Deal. Have you ever heard with, ever heard with wholesaling that it's like wholesaling can get you rich, but it can ever get you wealthy?
Oh, there you go. How old are you if you don't mind me asking? Yep,
So $10,000 a month, that's like what would $10,000 a month mean for you? What's significant about that number?
All good. Yeah. Daniel, just curious, what got you interested in Airbnbs in the first place?
But we've had several people that have gone through just really intense success
Like I said, we'll probably try to help go places where we can donate our time to third world country help
No, I don't know the numbers actually
Yeah, because I was just talking to one of our guys, Jerry, he's in Texas, he started about 12 months ago
I worked solid 40 hours a week there
We're just starting the planning and talking of where we wanna go and how long we're gonna stay and all that stuff
10 to 14. Is that gross or next?
And so just the fact you got your first property and you went through that process, you're committed
Oh, okay. Which city or county is he
But now in the last two years I've been looking beyond that and there's more to that answer
Okay. I'll get you in for 11:00 AM here and just gimme about 20 seconds to get you confirmed with that appointment.
Perfect. Cool. And then I've got tori Fulton gmail.com. Is that the best email for you?
So I don't know, but I like to just let things play out
Video that he's about to email me
Soon as I get everybody in the house, then I got to leave
It would be in the seven hundreds somewhere.
Let me see if I can get you confirm before that time today
So yeah, I'll take that call
He could do the part of the writing, taking care of a customer services and a reviews and stuff. Yeah. The response <affirmative>
It takes us two hours to turn over a place with us both here, but we're not doing that every day
And then as far as the rent, I'm looking forward to starting a second stream of income coming up
So you could literally bang that out tonight or tomorrow morning or something
I'm trying to going to court
It's not just about making more money for you
Excited to hear how it goes to you
Well the obvious answer is it'll help me get there in terms of financial means
So many times you look at all of it and it be like on the kitchen table on the counter
I'm helping out my daughter and son-in-law by renting a room at their house
Same fair. Kinda like the dinner party sort of thing. You tell people <affirmative> and then how long have you been doing that for?
Wednesday might be better and it should be better
And how's that? I'm listening. I'm open. Well
How do you feel that having an Airbnb business would help you get there?
I got it out of the 500, so it's pretty fair right now
I have different partners on different projects
And that might mean hundreds of thousands of people or more, right? Yeah, it's
I'm gonna see about getting you a electronic copy of the book right now
What would you like to get to?
Another thing you're gonna look at is your gross annual income, the income that you can actually verify with your taxes
But a hundred percent, a hundred percent. But does that make sense? Do those numbers make sense?
The elevator so I might you I'm in California.
I just am going for my second interview to get another J L B in a nursing home
Then occasionally I will do that
That would be with eight properties
You sound like an awesome guy and I'm excited to see it goes to you tomorrow
Okay. Yes. You want me to break down how that call would go if I can find some availability in their calendar?
So here's what I'm gonna do for you
You guys will get along really well
The last thing I have in the MOR on Tuesday is 11:00 AM
Yeah what's like the latest in the afternoon?
I want to go all over
Doing stuff that's more fun rather than just thinking of trying to figure out ways to make money to create wealth for myself
Fume fine. You can me, I just dunno if it's my patient.
I posted an ad and I made six grand from a doctor
I read through the book out, my wife also read through the book as well
So I'm curious, how are things going for you?
Okay, great. I'm speaking to who at the moment?
Within six months you're at $6,000 a month, and within 12 months you're at $12,000 a month
Now I do have to take a look other calendars first, but how does all that sound?
There's about 20 different ways to convince a landlord to do it
I'm gonna send over a calendar email or a calendar invite to your email address with your booking to the D home az
It was I work, No, it was w2. It was w2.
I'm starting with flips right now, but I do want to down the road, get into Airbnb.
When they have that number in mine, that's just fire for them
So that's my work number. I'm gonna send you my cell phone number cause sometimes we change your work number. So I'm the same myself.
Does that ring a bell around?
Usually it's either to get out a job or to do long term investing
It, it may have been like 80 something 80 between 80 90
You can do basic math I'm sure
So I'm only allowed to book these out about 40, 48 hours in advance
So just like a ballpark range
And yeah, don't worry about that
I was unemployed from January to April and so I'm digging myself out from that still
His name was Jerry's from Texas, and he's already up to 14 properties
We believe we will be, like I said, we won't a couple of weeks a week in September and then October, November
We just have to leave the calendar open for the paid consultations
How much is it? Okay, <laugh> pay for it and no problems
<affirmative> also <affirmative>, you probably run across that with a few of the older folks
So I actually work with Brian Page, Hopefully that name rings a bell
Yeah. And that sounds like to me, for you, it sounds like more of a starting point, right? I mean, you wouldn't just start. Yeah.
Got you off track and understandably so
Do you want me to share it?
I'm not worried about that for you
You don't have to deal with mortgages or lending companies, anything like that
And I'm sure you brush your teeth, right,
Rogers would definitely want both of you guys to be on if you guys are gonna be tag team and the Airbnb stuff
What I mean, does that make sense? Yeah
Well we got a particularly warm winter, so right now it was 37 degrees when I just went out
It's not a small thing and we want to make sure that people have the right information
All right, sounds good. We'll talk to you soon, okay?
And Deborah, before we hop off here Mr
So I mean it's, I, I've been doing scanning of the environment shall we say that
Noah Bin's calendar here and I'll make sure we have our time zones right
For sure. 100% Daniel. Okay, have an awesome day.
And then the landlord has to okay that in order
It, It's been years since I signed up for it so no, I don't remember how far I got in the course.
And so there's some parts of it that I'm still having to smooth out just because we're
The job is the job. It's 50,000 and
So the senior or the executive consultant has some context for you
One if something opens up beforehand I can reach out to you and just see if you can do something
So I just take three to five minutes to check in with anyone that got the book
Do you have any annual income coming in right now from investments or jobs or anything like that?
I mean, this point we've had over 10,000 people purchase the course
Yeah. Yeah. And why not? Why not? Right?
Okay. And why is that specifically? Are you looking to transition outta your current role?
Are you referring to income or how much you have saved up income
I'm doing fantastic. Just changing a couple lives today. Feeling good about it.
is Fumi kinda like the nickname you go by
Okay, yeah, that would be a perfect, I'll send over the video right off this call, so you do have that on hand
So could you help me take down some notes on that for him really quick?
I do but yet it's also limited, if you know what I mean.
We could do 11:00 AM or 4:00 PM
It's actually interesting cuz I was looking into that and I remember getting it but I actually don't remember receiving the book actually.
The rest of the week for me is slam. Dude, I gotta do at least mid to late next week.
I agree. But you guys are growing by leaps and bounds, huh? It's crazy.
They're gonna look at a few different things that can determine what you get approved for
I don't know how to put an end goal to it cuz there's never really an end goal
I just wanted to hit there first
Cause I know I live here in Utah and I bought a condo and I was going to Airbnb, but it mm-hmm
How much of the word, Say that again?
It would be nice to hear about, I would say 20,000 a month. Cause I own other businesses.
So you're an hour behind us now. You guys are on Mountain Time now
We also recommend that you get a small insurance policy as well, just to make sure you're double covered
Are you asking me if it's a good idea to wait before you start hacking?
And just a few more things before we wrap it up here for Mr
I won't have to be out here in the evenings working as much
So we're breaking even right now
Is there any kind of funding?
So that's talked about a little bit in the book
They just did not, And then they had a dog inside my house
A ballpark range? I don't need an exactly figure, just put 'em to kind guide you the right direction.
So I haven't read it yet, I'll be honest
We've been talking about it for a while now, so it's now kind of more about action, less talk more too
Paris sounds wonderful and I'm kind of jealous you have to go there already, which is awesome
And yeah, I don't know how muchand time I can make here for it
I'm gonna pass that over to Catherine and that's should be everything she needs to figure out what's best for you
So Saturday would be okay, just looking at some of the times here
So that was where I don't feel like it's gonna mess with my credit, but she, she's very scared of it
50 to a hundred K a month.
So I'll just shoot that to you via email right after this
I'll make sure to put that in notes so the consultant has that information
They work much closer with Brian Page directly
You have great energy and it sounds like really you just need to figure out how to get in that first property
I will shoot it over to you right now, make it work for you
But I mean really just cause they didn't get started, right?
So that's the model that he typically teaches students because most people don't have 50 K or a hundred K liquid
It's something I, I'd love to maintain and kind of show a high class and good attention and stuff
Well, the reason I'm calling is I'm the manager on our student success team for Brian
And I know I'm harping on it super hard, but like I said, they're just pretty strict
Actually, I'm gonna pull it up right here
Do you mind helping me fill that in real quick? Just a couple questions here
So I need to unpack what I got first
And she might help you out a little and she might help you out a little bit too with the business
So I, I'll be there, but what they call me or what I have to call them
And so they didn't really end up having any success
Yeah, I think she will be grateful
If that time does not work please reach out to me because of Mr
Boom. 7 66. Coming in with a big score. Congrats. What's your annual income
I, like I said, I don't even remember exactly when I purchased the course. Was it three
But I just wanted make sure that we were both aware of that
If I work 50 weeks puts it about a hundred thousand
So where would you like to get to long term?
It, but actually doing it is a tough thing.
<laugh>? I love the Grand Canyon, I love the dry air and I don't like the heat in the summer, the hottest I've ever been <laugh>.
The video's about nine minutes.
So I mean it sounds like man sounds you're putting in some crazy hours right now
I would say I think the afternoon any time after 12 would work
<laugh> and then I can Yeah, no, you're good
Kind of just trust the students
Probably long term options to pay for consulting is what I'm assuming is headed towards.
I mean I signed up for the program cause I wanted to do it
So that'll be about 2:00 PM at the time you're in right now
So just, it's kinda nice to stock policy cause you're like, I know I've got something in the bank, I know I'm, I'm covered
So on our team, we've got full time executive consultants who are light years ahead of me
Okay. Yeah, that's that's perfect. That
Let's put some stuff in action and let's get you some help here
Appreciate that, man. I appreciate that. It's so nice to you.
I just found out today under the kitchen floor, I had four beams that was right out from when the rain came down
Is how is health insurance of, I've been without health insurance before where I had to pay for it on my own years back
So businesses really need to realize that or anybody that wants a business
And I received emails and stuff, but I actually never received a book, which was really weird for me
And all of them have actually done six or even seven figures with their personal Airbnb businesses
And then you can get implement right away
Sometimes it's not just you as an individual
Annually? Shoot, it varies, man. I mean I can bring home anything from 35 to
Do you mind helping me fill that out real quick? It's just a couple of questions
Cause I already got one Airbnb in Florida
Added my third one in San Diego a few months later
And really, it's just gonna save you guys both a lot of time on the call today
I see. Well, I will be there at 8:00 AM
So I'm curious, what originally made you feel excited about Airbnb?
Yeah. That's cool. Well that's awesome. Would you go alone you think?
Just based off of, So I do a few different things
But also it would help them see the value in what I do so that maybe they want to do it as well
Okay. What was the question again? Sorry.
Eastern time. You wanna pull up your calendar for tomorrow? Just take a look at what you got going on.
When do you anticipate that you'll be home? Back in Seattle
And the average property nets about $1,500 per month,
It doesn't matter if it's something I truly love, I'll work around the clock
Do you know if you have one kind of
That's an add, that's an addition. I need to add that to my, what I'm bringing in right now.
Some faster, some slower, but that's about the average
Right. And it's spelled L Y F O R D for my name.
I mean it sounds good man.
But a hundred percent you guys will be in touch and she'll help you get all those schedules figured out for the program
Again, before I can, I like to study first before I can make my plans
Three years? Yeah. Awesome. And then, I mean are you doing cross country driving? What are you doing with that?
It's one of our jobs to really increase the student success rate and help people get results if we can
Now I gotta take a look at the calendar first, but how's that sound?
The only thing I got going on tomorrow is work <laugh> from eight to six 30. Okay.
Watch out for that at two 30 Central.
Most students, we have a lot of them that crush it, but a lot of people don't even do anything
I will say that now if it need to be like that, we would most definitely probably have to do it in the evening then.
We've got softwares that show what other Airbnbs are in the area
Well I mean, usually people wouldn't jump into a business like this unless there was a specific result they were looking to get to
But to do that it helps me to figure out where you're at and what you're kind of hoping to get out of this
It'll just help you get the most out of it
I mean California is, everyone that doesn't live here doesn't really understand I guess some areas aren't like others
And he's normally charging a thousand dollars for an hour of consulting <affirmative>
I'll take a consultation that's free. Okay.
But out of the few people that did go on to get their first property, they had really incredible results
And how much available capital or cash on hand do you have to put into deposits on properties, purchase furniture, that sort of thing
So I'm actually the manager of our student success team here for Brian
The ideal income I want to get with Airbnb a goal would be multiple millions of dollars of profit
Nah man, I I'll be sure to answer.
All right. Sounds good. John, appreciate you taking the time.
So that's the first thing to actually handle that problem
I mean it's just collecting a bunch of hammers
I was planning on 50% occupancy, which he talked about
<laugh> it is. Okay. So tomorrow four o'clock Eastern time, right?
Don't you think some folks would be coming in to visit their visit their kids?
So I'm gonna go ahead and send over a calendar invite to your email
I'm gonna introduce you guys after this call in a group chat and then we'll keep in touch throughout the week
So I actually don't even have the schedule open on Wednesday
So that'll give you time to write down questions, repair, and also give them time to repair as well
Yeah, for sure. I hear you man.
I'm gonna ask you four times
Would really allow you to do what you wanna do. <affirmative>. It sounds like <affirmative>.
Not bad, not bad. How about you?
Renzi know that you're committed to was the video and you're ready to go at 10:00 AM Wednesday
I'm super excited to see how it goes
Only reason I ask is the video is super important
Yeah, I wrote down all our, we need at least the goal is like 20 K a month obviously
So there's a massive shortage of hosts right now
So this can just pertain to you
Starting an Airbnb business without, Yes
Well I do have an amazing rest of your night and I look forward to hearing how it goes for you
Yeah, that's, So I'm excited about it
So what do you need from me?
So the a hundred thousand dollars a year is the initial goal
Is that a good one for you?
And he told my manager that outside of acquiring new properties, he's only working about five to six hours a week on this
Caught me off guard like a Saturday
Nice. Well, yeah, that's definitely on my bucket list.
It's just beyond your basic needs
And basically one of the things we're seeing is having the most success right now
Right? I mean, you could do it faster than that
Yes. I apologize for that. I had another call with someone and it went a little late.
And now 10 K a month, that is more of a starting point for you
Cuz we do, obviously these guys their time is super
Do you have a middle initial on that card?
They work closely with Brian, they have more time to do calls, longer calls to people
So is that time that you can a hundred percent
So basically the way our team's structured we have full time executive consultants on our team
Now I'm gonna hold you accountable, man, close some deals and I think you get this in the next week or two, man
I know I should have never done that. <laugh>
Fantastic. Thanks for asking. Just changing some lives today.
So that's what I'm gonna be doing. I'm gonna be leasing properties from owners to rent out. So I'm a big subleaser, Is that what this
So it's just shy of 150,000 a year
I live in California and a lot of that stuff goes on here
Might help me fill it out real quick, just three quick questions, we can do it over the phone
I just don't know where to go, how to get a good deal, how to see that this thing is gonna make income
I really liked, so me and my parents went on vacation to I think it was South Carolina mean, sorry, Panama City Beach
So not a bajillion dollars a month, but how much would that be for you?
I knew you were gonna make it
And once that goes through just let me know.
I've gotta take a look at their calendars first, but how does all that sound?
The great thing on the security job though is it's pretty easy
Gotcha. And you said earlier in the conversation, 75 to 85 is what you're bringing home each year. Is that an accurate number?
Umm, anywhere between 102 hundred K depending on how much time I'm spending out of town.
Okay. Now we're talking where Cancun Belize down there on the southern tip of Mexico.
So what would you recommend I get started with then?
And I think that will impact the leases you can get for Airbnb is your credit score
Yeah, I'm just not so sure about everything
I'll tell you that right now
If we did it did it on Tuesday, What time do you have available on that morning?
You just go ahead and open that up and add it to your Google calendar?
Oh, I'm just, oh I know
But if you've got somebody, I'd love to talk to them
It was it like a thin, It's a thin booklet, right? White cover. Yep,
That just takes about 25 minutes or so
I'm like a older mother after the baby <affirmative>, six year old
I love trucks and I love nice trucks
It's completely beautiful over there from beginning to end
So all of them personally done six or even seven figures with their personal Airbnb business
Yeah, actually I have a calendar right here
<laugh>, same stuff. I'm already doing <laugh> working. Yeah.
You like a 1 30, 30? Would either one of those work for you?
So let's cut to the chase. What is the nature of the call? What are you trying to sell me here?
Works. She's actually out, but I can tonight, she's outta town, but I can tonight.
So when you go to be listing properties on Airbnbs, if you're going with Airbnb arbitrage, a lot of times you'll get a lease
Well, I'm located in Pigeon Falls, Wisconsin, which we're in a population of 400.
So definitely his information definitely helps
Do. Yep, exactly. Yep, yep. I'll send you a calendar invite here.
And then just to double confirm, making sure I'm doing all my due dishes on my side like that
For sure. And I mean why is that important to you? Helping them specifically to get into
And what is your current annual income? You just ballpark it here.
So sorry. Yeah, I'm really sorry.
It's kind of like they probably do pretty well,
Okay, well that's good to hear.
But I probably said that'd take me to my properties
I have the duplex, but I'm always been from Montana
I have to put it in to do it
I would say I didn't really get very far with it
They work directly with Brian Page himself and they regularly are getting paid like a thousand bucks just for a single hour of consulting
I'll go ahead and I'm gonna send you over some that video that you can show to your nephew
Yep. <laugh>. That's pretty much it. Gotcha.
If I wanted to, I could be there
Well, I, that needs to creative to be quite honest
You know, developed a skill set
Well, let me be frank. We don't need all these questions. Why don't we get to the point?
Cuz his job isn't the greatest and he works a lot and doesn't make a lot <affirmative>.
So B, H A K T A
Let me check on that. I said Wednesday. Sure Yeah, Wednesday I'm open. Could you repeat those times ago or one I guess? Yeah,
<laugh>. That's funny man. You opened up like that <laugh>.
Wait, I mean, I don't know cuz I don't have this number saved or
But it sounds like this is something that is pretty important to make this happen for your kids
The three of 'em I just cleared up
Well, usually folks don't invest about a thousand dollars into a course or program unless there's a specific result they're looking to get to
A lot of people just lease the properties and put 'em on Airbnb
All right, so I will not be able to do it tomorrow
I'll go ahead and email that to you
What's the ultimate goal there? What do you really want?
Cool. And what do you do for a living?
Well let's see what we can do here
Are you asking me? Many? Just in general, how many hours I work a week?
So I was definitely looking into that
I'd imagine I'd wouldn't be so concerned about money anymore
I worry I won't make you look bad, <laugh>.
And I'll go ahead and send over calendar invite just so you can accept it after we hop off
Question for you. So obviously you recognize the name, you remember spending about a thousand dollars with us on the BNB formula course a while back?
<laugh>. Yeah, yeah, no, for sure.
Okay. And my second question is does he hold a fulltime job or is this his job?
Okay. And then what's your gross annual income right now? The number you could actually verify with a tax return from last year?
Awesome. Well Daniel, it's been awesome talking with you and I really look forward to seeing how our call goes today.
And then there's nothing else here
Okay, what is that? You want me to share it? I apologize
There's all these charities, charitable causes
Is that kind of where you're at or am I off on that?
But other than that, so long as that is good, man, I'm just gonna lock it in and I'll send you a calendar invite
I've just got first book man
Okay, understood. Yeah. And what time do you start work tomorrow?
Can you go ahead and accept that really quick?
And then he kept growing and kept growing 12 months down the line
But the other one is pure profit because I don't have a mortgage on it right now
Typically it is a thousand dollars slot
Let me pull up the schedule here and see what we can do for you
Do you want me to share it?
I was not expecting to spend a half an hour on a phone call
We don't get out too often, which is sad
I'm like, who in the hell is Brian <laugh>? Yeah, good one brother
And the average property, the way that we have it set up net's $1,500 a month right off the bat
No, I'm not against that at all.
Then I can text you from my direct work line as well after the call, just send you over some stuff
What would be worth it to you?
Do you think we can make, How much time do we need to go over with it? I really appreciate your sincerity
Yeah, no, absolutely. I'm excited. I appreciate the call tomorrow.
Yeah, I'm just looking for ahead, hasn't come in yet.
Just kind of has to do with the nature of that business
Understood. Yeah. And why is that one of the first things that comes to mind?
They actually work directly with Brian Page himself
And you can just watch that takes 20 minutes
Or if you figure out some way, let me know cause that that's impressive <laugh>
And so that's what people who own properties, when you go to rent them, that's what they ask for
That's awesome, man. And as far as $40,000 per month, where are you at now?
There are some areas in the US that make it a little bit more difficult. Yeah.
I'm doing well. How you doing?
They'll say yes, no maybe, and then you can just press yes and then that will confirm it
But I'll go ahead and email that to you after this
Well, the reason I'm calling you man, is I'm actually the manager on our student success team for Brian
So I'm gonna send over a calendar invite to you right now to that Gmail address. Would you mind just accepting it really fast?
It's just like, Hey if we can provide you some value, great
I have not. I'm not yet in as far as
More so it's probably about 60, 70, somewhere in there.
You know what I'm saying? Yeah
Low? Eight hundreds. I take eight 10. Wow.
So usually people don't invest about a thousand dollars into a course unless there's a specific result that they're looking to get
I love that I'm in the same boat man
Do you wanna have on people that you help?
And that's kind of how we got introduced to the whole Airbnb arbitrage thing
So last thing I'm required to do, just fill out a little form here for Mr
Yeah. So you're saying you need my credit card information?
Yeah it says Max credit line, it said Max credit line $22,000.
My wife and I just recently stayed in our first Airbnb, so not to be a hypocrite
Give and take. Let's see, man, I would say about maybe about six to eight grand.
45, okay. So what else do you have available with that? I'm sorry, I was thinking it'd probably be 15, 20 minute conversation.
I, I'm in the California Pacific time.
So is there any reason at all you wouldn't be able to make it?
Don Stratton is the guy that you got booked into one of our executive consultants
I can also email it to you
Yes, driving around carts. Taking care I guess. Yeah, around the place. <laugh>.
This is Cooper with BNV formula
I'd honestly hate for you to ever have to pay that
It? You definitely can. Yeah, well that's kinda what I'm getting at is that some folks like to donate it.
So it looks like we have, I know working VA probably some pretty hours
But what about the folks that you see that are looking to collect rent, the homeowners that are looking to rent out their spot?
I was just gonna ask if you don't mind me asking, what were you doing before?
Could you watch that before your call?
Do you have any pointers or advice or anything for me that I heads up that you think I should consider?
We can do it over the phone
So we took a look at the absolute bottom of the barrel students, the ones just doing the bare minimum but still having success
That's literally $150,000 a year in income, net income in just one year working two to three hours per week <affirmative>
Oh, what program are you guys on?
So, curious for you were you able to get started with Airbnb or what? What's going on?
Literally. And my favorite kind of food is sushi. I mean we got a plate for $2 <laugh>. Ridiculous. Wow,
If you saw the pictures you'd be like, wow, doesn't even look like the same property
This point we had over a hundred thousand people actually purchased that book
And the page that I was on initially, I was on the order page and then my battery died <laugh>
Oh, I'm so sorry. How do I pronounce your name?
So I'm an electrician by trade, so I'm a tradesman so it's kind of a nine to five
Kinda hard to think about not having the opportunity yet but stay anywhere
Sounds good. Thank you so much for giving me a call.
Yeah. What do you do right now for work?
But like I said, a Airbnb and that type of management, like I said, I'm only really required to work three days a week
I don't have a doubt in my mind that you'd be able to keep going at that rate
Shit, I'm right here in Nashville right now.
When it does come in then you'll be able to find the link in there.
But the few that did had insane success
I mean this isn't something that people are making thousands of dollar dollars just willynilly watching a couple YouTube videos
And so they're putting about two to three hours a week towards this Airbnb business
So nothing, I'm just a little form here
Oh, it would be amazing. It would be so great. Not have to worry about the grind.
It's so B E N O I T
Okay. Well, let me tell you a little bit where I'm at.
Being able to do all that, you'd be learning so much and making that income while you sleep
I can get more outta this house here
This is for Don to be able to guide you
And you have this vision like, man, if I get 10 K a month, you're free
Oh, that, if that's not at the top of your list, that's gotta be at the top of your list
So yeah, if you just randomly cancel no shows, something like that, we do have that fee
For that, is he there in Pasadena with you?
And so we're all invested into that
Deb and cash? I don't, I got this debt in my head, I don't have the cash to do it
And I love this real estate everything about real estate
I may have some of my buddies helping me, but he wouldn't necessarily be a partner per se
Well I'm not familiar with that see, so I'm fair. I'm not really technically savvy
So now everybody's doing the sprays
Yes, not completely, because like I said, I enjoy what I do, but like I said, more so the reason to obtain some passive income.
I do see some serious opportunity in helping you get to the next level here
I think we're in the same time right now with web three and crypto
Yeah, I don't really have much going on when I'm on this road. I can remember that you guys gonna call me, trust me. I gotcha.
I think I may have a super solid idea of how we could help you.
Shoot me a text after, just let me know how it goes and what's the game plan
So if that doesn't work, then that's okay
Kristen I hope you have an awesome day
Hey Kamala, this is Thomas with b B Formula from Brian Page's team
Well, I basically signed up for that and it's apparently nothing but internet. There's no book or anything, is that correct? Nothing in except internet.
You said it's like a pre-call video?
Oh, absolutely. So like I said, as of right now, I don't have anything on my calendar so as far as I know, I'm good.
Between me and my husband, I think we close to 150, 160,000 a year
Yep. Gotcha. So ideally, when would you like to retire? Realistically
I'd probably just do a lot more of that
Yeah understood. Is it with you're working with a business coach on your business or with Airbnb
So in that case, what I mean just make it work instead of doing things on my own without no experience behind it
No Dr. What time are you driving during the day
We have 75 year old grandmas doing this all the way to people who are serial entrepreneurs
Yes, that's fine. Let's do it.
What would be worth it to you per month?
But my goal is to someone double that thinking outside the box
My oldest will start kindergarten next year.
For you. And I'll the book go over the book in the meantime so I have a little bit of savvy before we speak.
Cuz these guys are literally the best in the business at this
Last thing I'm required to do is just fill out this tiny little form for Mr
I gotta figure this thing out
Four years. So you just had your daughter recently it sounds like. Yeah.
Yeah. Okay. If I had, Okay. Okay. Say 2020 would be nice.
Do you want me to break down maybe kind how that call would go if I can find some availability here in the calendar?
Hard to believe it's been that long, but I ain't done shit with it
It is just been, I need to do so much better
Yep. For sure. Okay, so $10,000 a month.
Okay, understood. Let me see here. And what about the rest of today? What about the rest of this evening?
You guys offer this time around? No other time? The second option. Second time,
So have our calendars up here
All right then you should be good to go
Okay. You know what your credit score is at right now?
The Airbnb people I've spoken to tell me it takes years to build up a good Airbnb
So we'll dive right into it
I'm on disability. I'm not working, I'm just getting out of the hospital. I still don't do rehabilitation and all of that, so not working.
Well it should be all the context that Mr
Just did it yesterday and it was 800,000.
I'm got a full calendar, so can we look at next week?
It didn't help us out, but it gave us a start
Okay. And what do you think would get it closer to a 10?
You're in a good spot there
I just texted the book, you should have just gotten link to it
Sounds great. With some of this stuff.
Okay, good. That's much better. That's much better.
You said you also like what?
Oh, I'm in east decent. What is that? Pacific on the New York time.
Cuz these guys are literally the best in the business at this
I mean a lot of people have had that concern and a lot of folks who actually got the course haven't gotten started yet
You said? What time is it here right now?
So it looks like we do actually have a few spots open
And I pretty go from there
He just wants to make sure that he's helping everyone that needs to be helped in your business
Three 12. Okay. Let's see. So, okay, it looks like we actually do have some slots tomorrow. We could do a 11:00 AM tomorrow on Thursday.
And that's been my biggest kind of, I guess, setback
Other thing here is we do ask a few financial questions just to see where you guys are at
Cause I mean, how long ago was it that you got the course?
I'm gonna take my chances ain't, I'm not going down like that
You cut out there. You said they charge how much?
Hey, this is Thomas B Formula. Brian Page asked me to give you a call and see how you were doing on your Airbnb journey.
You said a six 20. How about I got a six 16.
I know it's valuable which again would result in that a hundred dollars cancellation fee
Trying to get the hell out. Look as I can.
Man. And you have my word. You have my word. Your name will be in the prologue of my success story. <laugh>.
I didn't have the greatest experience as a kid
So I'll go ahead and lock you in for that time with Mr
And then just final thing here for Mr
Well, hey, best time plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best times today,
Okay. No, I will definitely be available for two o'clock.
Hey, what's going on Brian? It's Cooper with b b formula, just giving you a call back.
Okay, now that's with the folks that we've worked with
So I mean that's still, I guess some,
So it really is something that down the road can be something that's not crazy as far as time commitment
But it's like you have 10 months 11 months before you go back
There was one thing I needed to ask you
Whereas where we purchased our home there, it's just, it's the lake so it's beautiful
All right dude, I appreciate that man. Just cause like yeah, you know how it is. Yeah. You know how it is. Oh
And I mean for you man, it kind of sounds like getting to a $10,000 a month
And then I can basically send that to our company, kind like a middle man here
But I can also explain to you in detail exactly what to do and it'll be more beneficial than the book
In order to protect our executive consultants' time, we require a hundred dollars fully refundable deposit and we refund it
I saw you had his book a few months ago on how to create financial independence with Airbnbs.
And then also how to address the the mindset side of things, the emotional challenges and overcome that
Okay. Do you have anything as far as cash?
You guys can be on the same page
Yeah, I don't know the technical name of what he does, but he basically works on a electrician slash mechanic for fighter jets.
So all of the coaches have personally done six and even seven figures with their personal Airbnb business <affirmative>
So I told you what we can do
So I'm glad we gotta have this conversation, Kim
Which time zone are you in?
Hey, it's Thomas with b B Formula from Brian Pages team. How you doing?
Yeah, sounds like you don't remember
No a hundred percent students doing this all over the place, even in towns of 5,000 people
You're good to go on your side, you see? Yeah
I'm still on the path for military career to continue making rank and moving up and things like that
Well guess to get some context in whether or not she should
So if you could help me me by talking, cooking me does low volume that might build into larger volume
Yeah, man. Was there something that got you fired up about Airbnb in the first place?
But since you're already your student and you honestly I feel like helping you is helping my brother a little bit too
I got put the invite in my, I just flagged the invite and I'm gonna go ahead and put that in my calendar
And so she can a hundred percent send you over all the schedules and everything that's involved in the program as well
So many doors and opportunities, so, you know what I mean? It's like uhhmm, <affirmative>
I hear you and I think that's super important too and I love that that's kind of your reasoning for all this
Or how do you say your name?
Yeah man, I can definitely help you get some resources and materials or something like that
Okay. Yeah. That's a great goal. Well, and what would you do with some of the extra cash coming in from that?
We do three-way calls with husband and wife all the time
It could be a lot shorter than that though
Cool, Glen. Sounds good. We'll talk to you soon. All right, take care.
So I guess in a perfect world, no boundaries, what's the ideal monthly income you'd be hoping to get to with an Airbnb business?
So you'd be able to buy yourself back some more time, work less on it,
I mean you're kind of newer to the whole thing
All right, cool. And we'll have
Yeah she probably won't answer cause she's super busy herself
Awesome. Cool. And if you think of any other questions, just jot 'em down. You can ask your consultant tomorrow.
Brian Page asked me to give you a call to see how you were doing on an Airbnb journey
Not a whole lot. Maybe 10,000.
You don't have any conflicting meetings or anything like that?
Awesome. Do you know what your credit score is at? Is it like over a six 20?
So I'm gonna make it happen for you at eight o'clock eastern tomorrow
It would probably not know what to do with themselves. <laugh>,
The other person has no context at all and it's like, no, I don't think that makes any sense
Now I've got saturday dot real estate gmail.com is at the best email for you?
So we live that way sorta I
Have to think of it that way
I don't wanna just do just make money just to make money
And so for you to kill it with Airbnb absolutely just crush it
Is that the last name? Bridger?
How much do you need to replace your full-time income?
You kind of focus on automation and delegation
I have the money, I just don't have the time to research it because I'm just dealing with the day stuff every day
Especially depending on whatever happens in this economy and world
And I have a friend who owns three places
So I'll probably go ahead and take my social security and my wife will look into that herself
It's kind of one of those things where it's time and effort <laugh>
Lancer. So it's L A N C E R.
Cause right now I'm just blind
Yeah, I would say a little more
Lost quite a bit of money doing that
And then when leasing properties potentially in the future here, you'd be listing on Airbnb
Whether it's through doing something like this or starting my own acquisition shop or doing something like that
And these guys are literally the best in the business, the best of what they do
Benoa needs to figure out what's best for you
So I've gone to the Carolinas, I've gone in Tennessee I've been in Kentucky and mostly the southeast
Monthly. I might be overreaching here, but I would love to make like $50,000 a month.
And that property is netting at the lowest end, 1500 to 2000 bucks in profit per month
Let's see, tomorrow's Wednesday, tomorrow is busy. I could talk to someone on Thursday.
Maybe on the wrong date again
She doesn't even wanna work for anyone at all at this point
I followed the program, I got 30 units, I followed the formula
So I'll need to ask a couple questions to give them some context
So if you want to look, you wanted to look up our company BNB formula, Brian Page
I thought that was top light and that's why kind of rocking with you
I know it's supposed to snow tomorrow. Do you have anything at say after one?
So let's just do that tomorrow at 11
And you're talking about timelines and all that sort of stuff
That's something you want to do
Do not worry about that, that that's matter at all
20 hours. Okay, gotcha. And then your girlfriend working zero pretty much
Could you commit to watching that after we hop off this call?
Awesome. Well, hey, do you remember spending about a thousand dollars with us on the BNB Formula course a while back?
Whichever one makes more sense to you.
Yeah, that's my main goal. Just to lift my family up from a poverty.
And so I really don't think that he would have a problem waiving the fee for it and probably be able to do that
Yeah, tomorrow and Wednesday are both really bad
We've actually got full time executive consultants who are light years ahead of me
I think you can get there six months from now
Okay. And right now, what would you classify yourself as doing for a living
Well, consulting for, what do you mean?
Right now I feel like I'm at a five six.
Just curious, <affirmative>, why such a long timeframe for your first deal?
Okay. And you said your income was about 10,000 a month, right? Yeah. So over a hundred grand a year.
There's probably gonna be two emails and then one of them you'll see a link to add to your Google calendar <affirmative>.
And usually people don't invest into something like this unless there's a specific result they're looking to get to
Only reason I ask is just super important for you
So Youj excited to hear how this goes for you because it sounds like you're already a killer man running these businesses
And it's just a big old blank space on their calendars
Yes. Now when you called it popped up saying spam. Spam. So
Hey, this is Thomas. I'm just giving you a call back from earlier today.
And so I just wanna make sure you get all the value out of it that you can
Yeah. Okay. And this will be refundable as long as I take the phone call.
But is there a time tomorrow where you guys would both be available? Cause you guys don't have to be physically together
Part? And then I could start looking at other properties.
So let's just say perfect world, no boundaries
If I take the time to email that and text that over to you, could you watch that before your call?
Right? Well question for you mean how do you feel that having an Airbnb business would help you get there?
Yes, yes, please Send me whatever I need in the book and I'll get myself abreast of all the material.
And I'm gonna send over a calendar invite to email the Alcore 1276 Yahoo. We just mind accepting it really quick.
<affirmative>. And it seems like you probably had a pretty bad experience with that mash mind. Yeah,
Okay, so my thought process on this, we've got some full time consultants on our team who are more equipped at getting you time
Awesome. You got it in there?
I mean just rent it out enough Airbnb days <affirmative> to pay for the nut on the place
Are you like a Mercedes guy, You like German cars or what would you be going for?
And then Thomas, who has the available capital or the credit to help you get in and do some of these deals.
Awesome. So obviously the first thing to look at when you're gonna get a lease is your credit score. So what's your credit score right now?
I, Awesome. I'm looking forward to it.
At four o'clock. All right. Appreciate it, Sherry.
I've been looking for it for the last 15, 20 years
And I understand that's probably one of the initial goals and would kind of put you guys in a good position
I have an Apple card with a three
Mm-hmm <affirmative> stopping you from getting there? Right now?
Cause my husband's job was too
And it sounds like you definitely wouldn't stop at $5,000 a month
And once I have the know how to do it, man, I'm on it
Of course. The average property that we see with Airbnb is profiting $2,000 per month from just one property.
No, no. Thanks for taking the time and reaching out. I appreciate it.
And that's why a lot of people love the BNB formula so much is we do focus a lot on that
And this guy is amazing and really, really amazing
So that's just shy of about $150,000 in passive income at that rate
Well, the reason I'm calling you, I'm actually just to manage here in our student success team for Brian
Or No, that's all you need to do. That's all you need
So is there any reason at all why you wouldn't be able to make that call tomorrow with Mr
But first there's a cool point
I haven't even been hitting Zillow that hard or anything
Which time zone are you in
It was a while ago, right?
Everybody don't have that same mentality
So he's our top executive consultant, so I'm gonna get you on with him
Well right now I've just been driving in between Minnesota and Savannah, Georgia
Does that sound vague? Does that sound familiar?
All right, man, take it easy. I'll go ahead and shoot that video over to you and look forward to hear how it goes for you.
So for you, in a perfect world, no boundaries, what was the ideal income you were hoping to get to?
<laugh>, No kidding. Yeah. Yeah, I mean Lake.
And that one new property would cash them on the low end, $1,500 of profit per month
Yes, I work from home, but it's a flex schedule, so I work. Okay.
Now I have to take a look at their calendars first, but how does that sound?
I'm curious for you, cuz a lot of people have different motivations with traveling
But <affirmative>, I call it the of the wild man
Okay, I got you. Yeah man, what man, seeing that first deposit at the event, you count when it becomes real, right?
Whether you haven't started the course yet, maybe you have 10 properties
Yep. So basically the moment you show up to the call, our team will start processing the refund.
Sometimes it's not just you as an individual
Maybe like eight 10 or something like that. Seven 90 to eight 10.
So that really just takes about 20 minutes
<affirmative>? Definitely. So confirming he's gonna call me, is that correct?
All right, man. Talk soon. Yep. Bye. Bye.
And if I do have a success story, I just want somebody to thank that's it for the start process
And then, okay, I'll send it over to you right now just so you have it
I called about those leads with my person
Obviously that opens up a lot of doors
Know it's been forever since the book
Can definitely do 10 30 tomorrow
You go. I need, right, so I gotta take a look at the calendar first. I'm in the process of getting my first one.
Right? Cause it's like if you wanna get a 10 K month versus 50 K month, there's a hundred K a month
I am a licensed contractor and realtor and I run my own construction company
Okay, so you want me to break down real quick how that would go? So you know what to expect here?
Now I wanna make sure first that you'd actually be able to go out and do this potentially
So the one last thing I'm required to do is just fill out a couple things here so that Mr
Oh yeah, yeah. I'll even be back to my office, my home office by then. So yeah, I can, I'll be ready to go.
Okay. And your number is seven 17 number.
By rights, I'm taken care of my mother for three years now
Ideally how many hours a day would you wanna have free to just spend at home or spend with the family?
I'd get more into what I like doing
Yes. 11 o'clock on one through the eighth, Yes.
So do you mind helping me fill that out real quick? Just three questions here
Which one? Got a few of them?
Okay let me see here. And you got your business partner with you right as well?
Well, what would bring anyone to stay in the hotels?
Cause get that first property up versus having that same thing going for four or five properties
I mean I've been looking at small apartments and doing that
October. Oh, October of next year. Wow.
Well first things Kim, I wanna make sure that that's corrected for you That's right for you
So I'm just curious if you, you talked about starting now versus a year from now
All right. Gotcha. First name Saturday, last name Johnson, right?
I just wanna double check because we have a hundred dollars cancellation policy for these appointments just to protect their time
Yep. Arizona. Yeah. So we're in mountain time over here.
And then just final thing, I'd love to hear just how your call goes
So if you had to say what would be an ideal income for you from Airbnb if you started your own Airbnb business?
Putting your money to work, reinvest in
So it's not like I need anything specifically, but just
I just sent over the book to you right now
Sometimes it's not just you as an individual
Oh, okay. That's great. Yeah, that would be great.
I live near, well about 30 minutes away from Murray, Kentucky
I got appointments all through the day until the evenings
It's something that it might take a while to achieve
Yeah, I wouldn't stop doing what I do full time but I would like to do the Airbnb or whatever and something like that
I just sent you over the calendar invite and I will email everything over to the Hotmail account
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do for you because I'm not on the support team, but I do communicate with them
Yeah. And how much are you working now?
So yeah, what are you getting to for the Airbnb stuff? That's what I'm curious about
And then all a cost is furniture and such
So actually right now my focus is not passive income
And it sounds like some life situation stuff
I've taken the course and gone through the course material and everything
In the afternoon we have a 2:00 PM or 4:00 PM which one of those works best for you?
Get on the phone and people like, Wait, what are you saying? Who are you? I'm like, Oh it's right. Gotta, I
Tomorrow is a little bit tight. Is there any chance we can push in next week or
Okay. Go ahead and give that a shot.
Okay. This is one of my pet peeves is wasting time searching for things. I hate it.
All right, cool. Thanks a lot, man. I appreciate your call, bro.
They're a lot more equipped at actually getting new results than I am
Cool, Dustin, I will lock it in for you and let you go.
<laugh>, a simple answer you tell at dinner parties. Yeah. Awesome. And then how long have you been doing that for
She said she looked into it some and she kind of knows what we should charge and stuff for it
Well, a lot of places we want to go after retirement
I was just gonna say, do you wanna call him right now? You could just call him right now
All right bud. You too. Bye.
No, I mean the reason I got back into psychology was because I had a whole bunch of recruiters who were going, Hey, hey
I would say one 30 to four o'clock, someplace in that window.
Just a phone call? This just, he'll call you at three 30 and then here when leasing properties, it should be listing on Airbnb
All right, let's do it. Are you in central time?
And the video that we send you, we'll give you a lot more information on who Brian Page is
Yeah, for sure. Where would you go?
Wanna know, are any of the guys, if there is coaching, are they doing it? I wanted to know that too. Yeah, that's really important.
I'll go ahead and email that to you right after this, but we'd be able to watch that before we speak with him tomorrow
Yep. Just to help 'em out.
So I don't know how to put the long term goal into place for you
There's no straight blank sheet of paper to tell you this is what's gonna happen in six months if you follow this claim
Yeah, the R E E h. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> eighty1@yahoo.com.
Yeah, that'd be 11. Can you still make that?
And again, unless there's a schedule that I know that's there, I don't look at my emails every day
I can invite him, but he probably, he will not be interested. So
And so basically they look at two things when you're going to get approved releases
You feel like having an Airbnb business is something that you could build that could be automated, that would Oh, yeah
And you said you're in Eastern time zone? Yeah
But there's a possibility you don't want a possibly chance of a maybe or a no
So for this call, we're looking at no charge to me unless I didn't show
And then Java King 20 press one.
I talk to people which I love doing all day and so they are gonna be able to help you with that
So basically that would just be a starting point for you then
So I'd love to do it
And so I was curious on how you're progressing with the Airbnb so far
So if you got a house, sounds like you could say increase your options and your value in the marketplace, put it that way
It's just a few questions, would you mind helping me fill it out really quick? Great
And why would that be important to go visit them?
And that's another reason because we don't want to have too many people pulling credit scores.
11:00 AM Yeah, I can move this one back
And whether that's free resources, advice, things like that
I mean some landlords they might like what you're doing and they might decide to do it for themselves
Well Doro, that's all the context that our executive consultant needs to really advise you
And I know the program shows different techniques or whatnot having the owner partner up if need be
And then a couple of things here real quick just to what you can get approved for
<affirmative>. Gotcha. Do you think it's below like 650?
I'm either on fallout for or trying to get my computer that I've built myself up and running
And I'm in Los Angeles so it's a pretty hefty undergoing
Yeah. And then you have a little bit left over to play with.
Yeah, so he'll give you a call
I will. I'll email it to you and also send you a text. You have my number in case anything goes wrong.
Dude, I don't know what my credit score is.
Just to double down, on a scale of one to 10, you could be totally honest with me here
I'll shoot you an invite as well
And if that is the case, and obviously if emergency comes up, something happens, we get it, we're human, send me a text
Somewhere between 707 30 depending on which organization you look at.
And then do you do anything outside of that or is that your main job?
Is $5,000 a month, is that the angle or is that just kind of stage one for you?
It'll be Thursday, December 30th, 1:00 PM Eastern time
All right, sounds good. Great getting to know you and enjoy the rest of your week. We'll talk to you soon. Okay.
I do. Yeah. So I've got Bic BICA gmail or hotmail.com. Sorry.
Well on our team we have full time executive consultants
If I can get you an hour long session with one of guys for free, is that something you'd wanna do?
Do you know what your credit score is at <affirmative>?
Yeah, I'd had big dreams. Not no small one.
60, 30, 60 K a year.
Where do you think you'd want to go?
Yeah, understood. You feel like you'd be able to actually impact some people on a pretty serious level.
I believe so, yeah. I believe I spoke about that.
And how much money do you think you would need every month to be able to make that happen
What's like the ideal monthly income you'd be hoping to get to with Airbnb? I mean, what would be worth it to you?
Yeah. You know what I'm thinking about it. Can we schedule this after I get my first Airbnb?
I mean that's just a lot of time to do
Okay. That makes sense. And I mean how do you feel that having an Airbnb business would fit into that goal?
Couple shoulder operations and stuff like that and take a lot of stress
It's gonna be some huge things in there that would be incredibly profitable for you down the line
Then their goal is to serve as that skip button helps you get from where you are to where you want to be
I don't know if I can make 1000 after all the expenses
Gotcha. And do you feel like you're on the right path to creating that? Right now?
<laugh>, so I just have, I'm reading the book, but I haven't started yet
Well I have a, let me see Monday
Yeah. It was a while back that you bought the book, right?
And so you didn't ever get started on that sort of strategy, right?
But I mean you said that that might too far be too far out
To? No, no. Like I said, I,
It looks like it's good on our side, so you're good to go
Press set like the alarm on this iPhone and it just didn't really, I hate when every Monday alarm constellation
I've got LL Scott 99 gmail.com. Yep.
JH Bell 94 Gmail we're working with here
That would probably be, that would be the big goal
I'll get Diane, she'll handle all that stuff for you
Today? Yeah, the morning would be best before 11:00 AM.
What's up? This is Thomas DB formula. How you doing man?
Basically all I had to do was cover the closing costs, which was 10,000 bucks or whatever
It is just when you know wanna be somewhere else but you like, oh I can't move there, it's too expensive
I've been fortunate enough to where I've been able to navigate and never caught covid
But I'd say I'm doing about 1300, 1400 profit and I don't have a mortgage
Is Sherry really at the end of the day? Right
Well you're not cuz you get it back.
You're welcome, Raymond. Have awesome rest of your night guys.
So is that the end goal then to transition fully outta the healthcare stuff and then not have to punch a clock in?
I figured it would take at least two and maybe three to get to a thousand dollars a month
Hey. Hey, this is Cooper. I work with Brian Page. Hopefully that name rings a bell. How you doing today?
I'll make sure to let Mr
So if you just did the math there, that's two properties in 90 days
Let see what's going on The eighth
Dude, Google's got a secret. They're not telling you <laugh>. Yeah,
Of course it could. Yeah. Yeah.
Let me know how it went, how it helped ya
And I have a daughter who is four years old
So I just wanted to double check
Okay. So between the two of you guys, what would you estimate your annual income to be before taxes?
So there isn't actually right now she's going home for the weekend for her daughter's birthday and spending the weekend with them
And there's one less important thing I'm gonna send you over a quick five minute video
I have about between five and $10,000.
I'm gonna do for you's, I'm gonna do for you, I'm call one of our executive really gonna help you
But I don't get too high, don't get too low
Great. Is it alex comcast.net? Is that the best one?
So that's really the motivation behind it
And then on the call next week you have gone
So on our team, we have full-time executive consultants who are light years ahead of me
I'm excited to see where conversation goes with Catherine and basically figure out what's the best strategy for this property in blight
Okay. Are you busy right now? Did you say you were in school right now?
<laugh>, my dad's, he's, both my parents are immigrants from overseas, so they've been working hard, pretty physically
10 Airbnbs are the end of the year
Yeah, you can do a conference call and you might have to do some call merging and whatnot. Would it be in person with you?
It's got some great information in there
I couldn't name anyone, I'll be honest. <laugh>.
Okay. So the first question is what's your credit score?
Okay, so you guys are doing what, 3,200 a month collectively?
Oh yeah. I mean, if I commit, I'm definitely gonna attend and take notes. Yeah. Okay.
But now we're in a crisis situation trying to save the fucking earth
Brown needs to figure out what's best here
So I don't know, I was bringing, but I don't know how it's gonna turn out in what I'm saying.
I like what he does, but I don't follow his work as much anymore
I'm gonna email it to you
Where are you guys actually headquartered?
And so is your annual income say over 40 to 50,000 per year?
The one drop down to a six? I think it dropped to a six 60 something
I don't know if you're a member
Right. So it's 1154. So I'm thinking I'm in central,
And so that's just kind of a figure we look at just to make sure that folks have the ability to actually get started
So one new property every 45 days and that one property on average is profiting $1,500 a month on the low end
We know it worked three years ago
And the average property profits $2,000 a month
But at the end of the day, I want to be able to do one on exactly how Brian's doing it
It's called How to Become Financially Independent on Airbnb
That's awesome. What school do you wanna put 'em into?
Doesn't sound like you would stop there for sure
And final thing, man, I just love it
Yeah, I mean that's what I would be interested in is getting some income coming in first and then investing into more knowledge
Yeah, if you wanna stick to that
So I'm excited to see how it goes to that means
See. Well we don't sell tactics, that's how we're so's. But action takers are the ones, they're favorites.
So on our team we have full-time executive and these guys are a lot more equipped to get your results than I am
So it sounds like the target would be long term 60 k a month
Yeah, he got off to a great start for sure
Oh, okay then that'll be great. All right. I have enough time.
And just so you know, the way this works, it's super simple
But anything that I do the mortgage company has always been keeping their eyes on everything that I'm doing
I just sent it and I'll also send you some extra videos you can go through as well before the call
Because you kind of are newer to the whole Airbnb business
And then we can just go from there
Timing, Not that I don't want to, it's just trying to step into that pursue it, look into the program
Lancer has the context that he needs really just to help figure out what are the kinda leases you can get approved for
So I mean, to get to that marker I'd assume I would've be absorbing a lot of my time
Grossing. So what are you netting per month?
They don't give you nothing for interest, which you should have your money working for you as well
So I'm gonna get the deal, send it to them, let them take care of that
Yeah, we have a ton of things that we provide our students
Central. Gotcha. Okay. So it looks like, because
And I am really bad at asking for support
Of course right now, man, the Marcus kind of fucked up <laugh>, but nah, it varies
The only reason I ask is the video is super important just in order for you to have a great call
She was sick and going from nursing home to nursing home and a bunch of abuse and stuff
Sure. Obviously just the financial freedom that comes with that money coming in, being able to take less hours at work and more hours at home.
And so it really help Mr
Okay, cool. And you're totally willing to show up, fully focused without any distractions, right?
And so you're breaking even on that right now
And I think I have a super solid idea of how I can help you out
Well, which city are you in?
I'm in the mountain time zone.
Well, I've actually been a few places in the US so I wanna start going like, Oh, I wanna go Africa
Just in general. That could be your own, could be new ones, how much you want to be clearing every single month. What's your goal there?
But that's what I can get off my business, off my trucking business right now
It's a beautiful state and I want to go up to the northeast minus New York City
We actually have been helping a guy who started with us last year in February of 2021
So I got three more to finish clearing up
How much simpler it seems than we think, Or at least I thought.
I did just hang up the first time and then you call back, I'm like, well who is this all night
Awesome. And the best phone number for the consultant to call you on is one we're talking on right now?
Okay. Well thank you so much, so much. I will look forward to that call. Put it in my calendar where I can block my.
So ballpark range, what's your credit score at Right now?
I guess in this world I guess That is right.
We'll send you a calendar invite
So essentially with the course you bought, Brian does do some open q and a calls with it
I feel like I have, I should pay something
If I move there, where would I work? Oh I'd have to take two jobs
But I'm trying to switch over to get more into real estate
Happy Thanksgiving, man. Happy Thanksgiving. Save you some Turkey, right?
Do you actually know the numbers behind it? Traditional real estate versus Airbnb?
Could you watch the video after we get off this phone call?
So here's my question to you
Understood. What is your girlfriend's is credit?
I was just about to say, yeah, let me, You wanna stay on the phone real quick? Let me call him real quick.
Well dude, I mean, honestly I gotta say it sounds like you have a good level of self-awareness where you're at right now
Just to protect Brian's executive consultant's time and Ryan
This takes time where I live to drive back and forth.
I say that's a wonderful attitude to have going into it
Central. Okay. I wanna make sure I correct. Actually, you know what? Let's see. So that would be your centrals your
So I haven't really done much with it, but it's still pretty cool concept
Okay. And as far as Airbnb goes, how do you guys feel that kind of fits into your plan there?
How about we set up a call,
Good, good, good. Sorry for answering the phone like that. I thought you were a spam caller.
November 12th on Friday. Okay. Now Friday I'm doing the move.
So it's just more that I can do
I do know 5 27 and 5 22 is showing
R, right. And then the card number whenever you're ready.
Monday. Do you have about 45 minutes available at 12:00 PM
All right, sounds good. Ugo, I will call you tomorrow. Have a great weekend.
I'm gonna put you with him
Shit. <laugh>, I think Western Pacific. I live in Arizona.
And so it's just a few questions
Oh, I'd probably put it at 30 grand or something.
My wife is a stay at home mom with four kids, man
I'll send you a reminder maybe on Thursday
And then that's just like a policy
<affirmative> give at least three to four
Yeah, text me. Can't answer. Let me try calling him.
I do have business credit cards.
And make sure it's an AM and not pm.
So we we're done with everything we need do here and then I'll let Mr
<affirmative>. And so if you had everything working for you, then you'd be able to have some more free time, right?
That should be all that he needs
And then what's your annual income from that? What's
Because during the pandemic I didn't even lose money
I'm doing wonderful. Just over here trying to change the world. <laugh>,
They're far more equipped at actually getting new results and helping me scale than I am
Which we really appreciate here at the company as well
I'll go ahead and get you locked in for that time. Okay, cool. John and last name, is it pronounced Guzman?
All right. Of course. You too. Take care. Bye bye. Bye.
I'm doing fine. How are you doing?
That's something for the other three days of the week I could look and put some energy into if you understand what I'm saying
And if you did, you'd probably be like, Wait, hang on
Now I'd have to take a look at the calendar first, just see if something would be able to do
Right now? Like I said, I'm in the process of skipping a move
Thank you Thomas. Best luck. You as well.
Okay, man. Well I really appreciate the time and I look forward to it.
Cool. Well Steven, what time zone you in?
Okay. So what's the full name on the card?
A hundred percent chance I will be on that call.
<laugh>. I got you. I got you. <laugh>. Hey, if I'm making 50 K a month, man, I'm bringing you with me. Matter of fact,
I dropped a big amount of money on real estate and of course the market changed and wow, it's just not happening
So it's not the best I know, but it's definitely better than what it was, that's for sure
It's bad, I gotta get it
Don't say Brad for the course
And also you have capital that is raising all the time
And so long as you're paying them their rent, which is ultimately all they're looking for, they'd be happy to have you
Sure. Sorry, what's your name again?
Okay, yeah, I'll email that right after this call
So I need some residual income
Cooper. Okay, great. All right, thanks, Cooper. I do appreciate it. All right, Robert.
That's a lot better than what it used to be
So I mean that's the ultimate goal
How much would you wanna be bringing home each year with Airbnb a year from now?
<affirmative> spouse. I don't know if she'd want to get involved, but she might.
<affirmative>, so it sounds like really that just financial freedom is what's important to you
Airport. How long you been doing that for?
Then you pay the landlord back what they're asking for rent
Yeah, I'm curious. I'm what they
I am in Central. I'm in Dallas, Texas.
And it's before your call, Mr
If I send those videos over to you in total, they're about 30, 40 minutes long
So it'd be nice to do family relaxation kind of travel without having tons of business work to do
But you would quit your regular job?
The book is how to become financially Independent on Airbnb
It's probably be a few days from now
You're living with your mother-in-law right now? Yeah.
What's like that ideal monthly income you're hoping to get to with Airbnb?
And you'll have my number as well, so you can text me if you need anything
I'm ready to change my perspective. Okay, thank you.
Okay. Okay. Let's see. For me it's 80 something like that a year.
So I actually have would seven on the
So it'll be really great for you guys to take a peek at that
I'm gonna put you with Mr
Yeah, Monday, Monday's fine. That's actually good timing. I'm, I'm pretty packed the rest of the week.
So I'm excited for you, man
Yeah, that's my mentality as well
So were you able to get started with Airbnb or what's going on?
<laugh>, I had to completely remodel it
So why you got some another got some more info to,
I'm really, really glad we connected because it sounds like this is something that is more than just a surface level
What time zone are you in?
Oh really? Now am I able it any kind of property or is that limited to
But what I'm gonna do for you I'm gonna talk to Catherine and I'm sure that she can do 5 45 for you
Yeah. I dunno. Two or 3000 bucks a month or something.
A hundred percent man you're already shown that you can implement and be successful
So he'll give you a call at that time we have scheduled and I'll send up you some texts beforehand
Okay. So I will get an email with the link and everything.
<affirmative> really the ones that did the bare minimum but still had success
Well actually one of the things that we like to do on my team here is we're just on the success team
Well the reason I'm reaching out to you is I work here with Brian and I'm a student success manager for him
So no, right now I don't know the numbers
I think it'd be a way to get started with it
Everyone that I place on his calendar, he just makes sure, like I said gets you to watch that pre-call video beforehand
And we're, I mean, it's not for some people, but it is what it is
Seems like they must be taking a toll.
Yep, I'll shoot that ebi go to you in the email.
Yeah, yeah I don't mean right now
I'll make sure to let Mr
Is that Dwayne Foster then 45? Is that the best email for you for that calendar invite? Yeah
Sometimes they would even decide, I'm just gonna go ahead and quit my job and then go full full-time with Airbnb
Sounds like a number I'd be comfortable with
Remind yourself I'll send you a text, but just cuz their time's valuable, it sounds like yours is too
Tell me about Airbnb for you
So typically we don't book these consultations out more than 48 hours in advance
In addition to that, the property here in Detroit is value is growing
What would that feel like, man, to see those programs go live and see the impact that you'd be thinking
Okay. You were just skiing you said?
We've completely changed it probably because of some of those things
And I hate if you'd ever have to pay that
I'm probably about I don't know, six, six and a half.
Which time zone? I'm in Eastern time zone. Wow, that's a question I don't get often. <laugh>,
All right. Me the other, Hello?
I think so. It's certainly something I'd be open to doing, so I'd be happy to go through it.
Okay awesome. Is that always been a goal?
Jesus. Is that the case, man? So I'm from Seattle the greater Seattle area actually. And it's not happening.
I purchased it, yeah, I own it.
<laugh>, they're out there, man. They exist. They
This may have been a while when Brian teaches going out for Airbnb
Yeah. Yeah. Thomas <laugh> the full thing. Yeah.
Now obviously if that's the case, well then that does require a higher level of investment and it does cost some money
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense
And he told my manager that outside of acquiring new properties, he's only working about five to six hours a week
Fantastic. Question for you. Do you remember spending about a thousand dollars with us on the BNB formula course a while back?
They can call me around this time, same time I usually to go to run
Jackson know ready to go on Wednesday morning and you're committed to watching that video beforehand
So I don't really put out my eggs in one basket
Funk, just make sure that anyone I place on our calendar, this washer is an important pre-call video beforehand
Cause I mean that wouldn't be fair to you
Wanna believe. I wanna believe. Yeah,
Yeah, it was just less than 40.
So your name went by really fast for me. Would you like to give your name
Amazing. I'll talk to Mr. Brown tomorrow. Thank you
Okay, fair enough. Well so you're in Arizona time. That makes it super easy here. As far as your schedule for tomorrow, everything looking like,
So it wasn't really something I too much worried about
That's crazy. You really think so?
So if you could just go through there, maybe jot down a couple notes, jot down a couple questions
Gotcha. So you at about six 70 credit score and 150 annual income
Just not knowing where to start and before I just jump the gun and do it
<affirmative> doing the leasing the home and then putting on Airbnb so it takes way less capital.
If you give someone an opportunity they can grow from it
Well, it could be a complete waste. I don't know. Just depends upon how much
So you go out, you get a lease from an owner, talk to 'em, you say, Hey, this is what I wanna do
You looking to liquidate in about three months?
Noah? Oi, so you can best prepare for your call?
So I don't like to just throw money down a hole and never see any value
You can text me if you need anything and we'll just go from there and we'll talk soon
We started back in August and <affirmative>, there were a lot of repairs that needed to be done, a lot of things
Thanks so much. Yes, four o'clock Eastern today. Actually, Sherry, hold on a second. You said F you said four 30, right?
Just it's been hammered with bills lately and it's been the perfect storm, so maybe it's a good time for a change, I guess
Yes. I have to check with his appointment too, so see what the timeframe on that is.
But what do you think there?
Come be one of our consultants and you can help people out
So probably about 40,000, which is still good
Keep it clean, keep it pristine, and it's automatic
I wouldn't be able to verify. How would I be verifying it?
I know it sounds like small thinking but I'm actually pretty happy with my life
Get my mind off of stuff sometimes
Oh yeah, let me call him. Gimme one second. Cool.
Just so that I know exactly what's going on with you in your situation
Okay. And what is your gross annual income, the number you can verify with your tax returns from last year?
So before we get you locked in here just make sure this is something you really want
Okay. Gotcha. And then as far as what you have for deposits on properties F sale, how much capital are you
Under a year? Under I don't know the exact amount of months, but I know it's been under a year.
Now all I need to do is work my business and make more So <affirmative> that's pretty much it
Now obviously that's like, that's a big long term goal, which is awesome
I believe you don't need tons of money to start up and things like that
Okay, see? So let's do that instead because I don't wanna miss you. You know what I'm saying? So yeah,
So it was about 1 52
But it may be way more profitable for you to actually Airbnb that property
Not every landlord is going to be game
All right Jerry, appreciate the time and looking forward to that text.
The best well, I don't know how you know familiar you are with the b b model, but essentially give you a quick rundown
But as long as you show up you'll be good to go
Just just slow because right now I'm devoting a lot of my time to my job in school
Oh geez. Yeah, I'm not so sure about that. I haven't come across that too much to be quite honest.
Mean I don't know if you've heard it quietly like that, but <laugh> No,
I did, I did. Yeah, it was awesome.
So first off, I just wanna apologize for that John
Well the reason for the call today is that I saw you hadn't had a chance to speak to that from our team yet
Last year was 1 0 4.
And they're really the experts on it
You guys work directly with Brian Page and regularly get paid $2,000 versus single hour of consulting
Yeah, that one. That wouldn't be a problem.
You just go ahead and you pull up the clock app.
I would basically use some of it for trading
Of course. Thank you. All right, bye-Bye.
I'll go ahead and email that to you right after this, but we'd be able to watch that before you speak to Mr
It should be 40. Oh 41,000.
Well none yet, but <affirmative>, I have a really good, and so I'm like,
Do you want me to share it? Okay
So they pay for everything. And she scheduled basically the Airbnb part of it.
Yeah, she could be on the call.
Crypto. Yeah. Cool. Is that on Touro?
I don't love the money for the sake of money
My name's Christian, I'm with Bri b and B Formula and Brian Page's team
Okay. And how much available capital or cash right now do you have to put into deposits on properties or purchase furniture, that sort thing?
Okay. Well, I only have the availability to book this out up until Saturday.
<laugh>? Yeah. Hey do you remember spending about a thousand dollars with us on the b and b formula course A while back?
Is that, that's like why you were interested in looking at him because you saw that he had that guarantee
Okay, cool. You want me to break how that call would go if I can find some availability in the calendar,
The second year I only did like 22,000
Sure. Have you been York City?
Well I, I don't know, I guess there's a lot of places I'd like to go yet that I haven't been
So just wanna be fully transparent with you and make sure that you can make it
Well that's all the call about
Maybe about $3,000. No, that's not a lot.
Yes I would say that. Okay.
Yeah, so this is our main work number and we have a few success managers here
Right now in that realm and the things that I've been doing in my other investments, I would say I'm about 10 right now.
So Airbnb is a possible way, you're looking at replacing some of the income, being able to cut back down to your hours?
You said am I clear on it? Yeah. No, I'm
Absolutely. And can you remind me of your name I caught you? Brian
You don't see anything yet. Something from your is confirmed
Hey Kristen. It's Thomas b and B Formula from Brian Page's team. How you doing?
N S S S E R
I don't know, maybe we'll get to the point where we got enough
But as of right now, I can't really dedicate time for that right now
So that's kind of the range there
I'm not gonna say I'm gonna be there, not be there, so I'll be there.
Should be coming through it any minute
You had about 700 credit score and annual income
I do what I do not because I love it
Okay. So you purchased the properties and now you're just running Airbnb out of it?
Okay. And then what is your gross verifiable income, the number you'd be putting on your tax return last year?
They're over, I would say about seven 40.
Yes. May I ask who's calling?
Have a good week. Done by. Bye. Bye.
We could do 11:00 AM on Monday or 3:00 PM on Monday
I was gonna do pricing strategy more today I don't think so
Well I mean if you rent like 3000 or something as normal, we would think between two and three times that we would think
Hey Justin, it's Cooper with Bmb formula on Brian Page's team. How's it going?
Oh, awesome, awesome. Oh that sounds great.
So that's when I really started to scale
To leave my job, if I can pull in what I'm making at my job, I'm comfortable just living off that
It already said your booking this confirmed but it don't give you the option to click on it. How long,
Oh man, I did. How long have you been doing that for?
I can email that to you right after this
You said what? I'm sorry, what'd you say? I'm sorry.
And whenever you're ready, you just go ahead and read the card number four digits at a time from left to right.
Breaks down some master as you can some of the folks that are what they're doing to be super successful in it
Yeah, we, we'll reschedule the one that's on Monday just because if you get the information then you don't implement how it dies. Right. Okay. So,
Sorry, I'm just running into little with the calendar
Well thank you so much <laugh>
So then they average that around 70 on it
Yeah, I'll just put 7, 7 10 or something
And once that does happen, I'll make sure to send you a text as well
You still need money coming in
I think getting off the boat is a major thing
If I take the time to email that over to you, we watch that before your call
What can I stick with you on this?
Answer your question, no, I haven't done anything, but it is something I still do, still work on it.
Well, my FICO score is 7 37.
Gotcha. Tell us why so long to get the three properties.
And so I'll send you over some videos you can watch to get a better understanding of the B business model, how it works
I'm excited we got to connect here and I think it may have a super solidity of how we can help you
So I had these little kids and they still respect me today boys and girls
And then I just kind of thought about landlords around me
So it's really just gonna take a few minutes
4K is like you're really starting to stretch it and you got about 700 credit score and about 76 income
Well I don't love, but I do believe money is a cool, I agree
To replace, that's pretty much just to match what I make at my full-time job, right?
Okay. What time is on you in
So he would definitely able to help you out
So do you offhand know, ballpark what your credit score is?
I, I mean I thought I was paying a lot of money for crap insurance and that was when I was single
People through required things like that and all the liabilities with it as well
Well, the reason I'm calling is I'm actually the manager of our student success teams
If I could give her a thousand dollars a month, that would help
I don't know, think it's a new time. I wanna get
Yes, Yes. I need to get to multiple properties. That's what I want to get to.
Absolutely. Anything that I can get I will take
There's levels of the financial freedom, right? Because the more money, more problems
You feel like your Airbnb business took off and you got to those numbers that you'd ideally be able to do that better?
Gotcha. So you work fulltime, you're working full-time there or part-time, like what's that look like for you?
Well, the W two, let's see, I think last year I had about 65,000
Okay. So can I ask you, just so you're with B and B formula?
They really have to do with how the person thinks and the specific mental models that they operate with towards their Airbnb business
Yes. Yeah. Makes more sense now. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, better business credit. You can get better releases and a whole bunch of stuff like that.
He just wants to make sure that he's helping anyone that would need to be helped in your business
Where do you take your rv? Where can you go?
So for you, what does that mean? What do you freeing up?
So there's a lot, just know freedom
Rogers consulting process, he always makes sure he's helping anyone that might need to be helped in your business
So I won't be able to do that in the morning tomorrow
And so we're very selective with who we bring in
Be nice to, I mean thinking on the small end of things, just be nice to make a couple extra thousand a month.
I mean it's like for business purposes and my annual revenue would be it was 4 28
You gotta be that you're fully focused
Cool. I can have my wife watch it with me or is it just for me?
My mom made sure I had everything that I needed and wanted
So you enjoying the course then you you'd recommend it to some folks?
I'll go ahead and lock that in for you, David, and send over a calendar invite
Can you tell me a little bit more about what you mean by that?
Okay. So if you got off that boat, how much extra time do you think you'd have on your hands?
No, it sound, I'm definitely interested in that. I'll be willing to do that. I'd be a great opportunity.
Right? Yeah, exactly. The bmb formula course. Yeah. So all about it.
E h a kt a brothers dot coms.
And I'm hooking you up here and so basically what happens, so they're actually pretty crazy
No, not at all. What is that?
I'll email it to you right after this
So you might as well make the fucking most of it's kind of what I feel the perspective
All right, beautiful brother. So good. You actually got my attention and you're in the right location so hopefully it all work out.
Do you guys have any idea what's looking like
Your thing, I'll go ahead and lock that in for you right now and send you over a calendar invite
So his first name's Noah, just like n o h
So it looks like we dig What
I've really been paying more attention to it in the past eight years
So this is actually our group number for work
It'd be like based off my business what I do for 10 99
They charge about a thousand dollars an hour for their Airbnb consulting
1230 is that a hundred percent of the time we can lock you in for your availability and everything
I've been dragging my knuckles around a little bit
You wouldn't just stop there completely
Send out to you? Is there any way we can help you? Okay, so brand
You can rent out somebody else properly and it just seemed complicated to me
Figure out what kind of leases you can get approved for
Which that in and of itself, cuz it's Airbnb 1600 rental, I could probably double that and make $3,200 easy in the area
Just saying before we wrap up the call here for Mr
So I mean, sounds like you've done pretty well investing, you got a job
Really crazy red rocks and really crazy national parks and deserts and
I've got a 10 30 or 1130 in the morning on Saturday
Let me check the calendar here and see
Right now my score just dropped
Okay, yeah, so I didn't explain that
<laugh>. No, it's been a while, man. Well, you remember spending about a thousand bucks with us for the b b formula course a while back.
And earlier you mentioned paying off debt and that's totally a personal number so you don't need to share that
How long have you been in the job where you're traveling?
We've been to Europe before, we would like to go back and explore a little bit more there
I know it was a while back when you originally got the book, was there about a year? Something about the bus
That's all the context that Ms
A group. I'm looking for it. Let me see. Ah, okay,
I mean we already divorced so it's my to be spending daddy time with them today, so
Four hours? Did you see it's a four hour call?
Mm-hmm <affirmative> giving back, not worrying about certain bills, not worrying about medical
So I'll get the most out
So I'm trying to get some business funding can't really get that hard pull right now
So I'm extremely grateful for it and I'm looking forward to at least hearing about this stuff
So I would say I need 250 grand to pay off my house
Yeah, I don't think any of us would be complaining of 15 K a month in passive man
Yeah. You said it'd be one hour?
One. You're welcome. Thank you. Bye bye.
And your situation's pretty unique and they're gonna have access to that sort of information that I don't necessarily have access to
Do you have any properties of your own?
I actually don't know if I even have a credit score just yet. I, I'm like fresh 18.
I do have massive bills, obviously with running a business and I've put down personal income as 85
Cause the thing is I just wanted to triple check on that
And I know with verifiable income for 10 99, they'll look at two years history
So important for you to leave a legacy for your kids?
Well, we love to start out talking about those summer months 2021
Would be, You want me to share it?
Take Yeah, whatever it cost for the Airbnb
And so Luke, you're working 60 hours a week right now doing bartending in school on top of that
Well, as you can probably tell in my position, my knowledge base and my expertise is a bit limited
Yeah, yeah, I did. I remember it.
Wow. What's that? Are you putting in a ton of hours? It sounds like you said pull
So she's in the office again on Monday and Tuesday
Tomorrow is Thursday. I'm off, I'm home. I'm home around four o'clock central time.
I just talk to my network about it
<laugh>, that goes back to making more money
And I feel that this is something that could work for me if I have the proper knowledge to do it
Cause I got, like I said, I'm less insurance agent and also I have another business house
They tried it on their own out in Arizona, I think it was Arizona
But this year one job is 14 hour
She's one of our executive consultants and so she's really more of the expert on the Airbnb stuff
Those are the things that really aggravate me in life and getting started and even doing what I'm doing
Okay let's see, we have some early afternoon spots
Let's see what I can do
And it's one less important thing cause just got home
So you said you wanted to retire in two and a half years
Tried go to a dive bar.
But if that's like, No, that is a complete waste of my time, that wouldn't be a complete waste, then no worries
<laugh> for sure. Dude, I'm, I'm right there with you. You go.
How much is it? Oh, 20 grand
So we have, I think with Brian Page, basically the guys doing the Airbnb stuff and wrote the book
Let me just refresh the calendar here, see what I can get locked in
I am a verbal I love vrbo
At 12 I 12. Sure. Right. I got that.
So 12 months down the road he had 14 properties all using rental arbitrage
What would you do if that
I mean on average, On average, man, I'm gonna be honest with you man, I don't use my money man
Diane, what, a 2:00 PM Eastern Time? Dan's the head of customer support
We do <affirmative> get some furniture, deliver, set up the TVs
We have some who are working remote, some are out in Carolina with Brian
I don't know exactly, but yeah, the w2, I had affiliate marketing online
That's cool. So you would travel more for sure.
I want the life, I want the freedom I want off the goddamn boat.
Sure thing. Yeah, exactly. So for you mean what would you do with an extra 10, maybe $15,000 a month coming in?
I can email it to your partner as well
When I go look at a property, I decide whether it's gonna be a cliff for a short term Airbnb
A while back. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Oh, I, I'm just trying,
I'm glad you reached out to me
So Lorenzo, what time zone are you in
Oh yeah, Yeah, sure. I can watch that.
Because honestly I only wanna lock this in if you're a 10
I would definitely like it to go to my Mississippi home.
Awesome for sure. Be able to go through that, maybe take some notes.
And then what's your gross annual income at the number you'd be putting on your tax return?
So <laugh>, <laugh>, dogs barking in the background and doorbells ringing and yeah, it's crazy
We haven't even done that yet
We need to hit that 10 K
It's 1215 right now. So central, I guess
But that shouldn't be an issue for you
Gotcha. And you have about 45 minutes at 11 for our consultant to walk you through how to deal with the landlords and the leases.
So you'd probably be looking at about four properties for that check 5K month
Not about it, Not what he does, not the timewise, I don't know how much I can count on him
Rogers, just make sure anyone I place on his calendar does watch an important pre-call video beforehand
Now I have to take a look at the calendar first, but that sound
So it has to be a lot of trips
And so that's the biggest thing that you're struggling with now if you're start getting into this is in those landlords say yes
And if income wasn't an issue, I don't think it would be a problem
Yeah, that's, appreciate that to my attention
What's that ideal monthly income that you're hoping to get to?
I'll just put a master smile on my face and honestly, it's what makes my job fun here,
I'm a hard working son of a gun
You said your credit score was about a six 40, but you're working on it, right?
If you want to be, be quite honest,
I got family and parents that I'll support.
Just take a second. So really quick, you said your credit score was six 40
Yeah, look us up. If you've got any Airbnb, you should definitely use this to clean your windows since you're here in the valley.
Butler which is awesome because he is amazing and helping people who are looking at getting started
Well, I'm not sure exactly what that would look like for you
So I'm curious to see how it goes for you
Got actually setting up an Airbnb that's gonna launch tomorrow, so
Okay. Understood. Yeah, take a little bit of pressure off.
You guys can show up to that
He's a superstar, he's a really nice guy
Maybe if the eviction moratorium were listed
I was just wondering if people set up there, cuz for example, talk, I know that's a big thing over there during Covid
Yeah, I got a book sometime a while back. That was a
And we could just do it that way cuz it'll be a little outta ordinary
Yeah. So with rental arbitrage, the average property net's about 2000 a month. So you could do that with one property.
I mean, they're light years ahead of me
I would say between anything that you're doing.
Is it gonna be a video call, a Zoom call, or is it just a phone call? This,
Thomas. Okay. So on this path, Thomas, I know we haven't talked about it, but what's the price tag look right,
So I'm gonna email that to you right after this
I'm in my third year of real estate
I like him together for maybe six months and come back six months
Gotcha. And then you did it, you were successful?
And obviously sounds like the portfolio, the business, whatever the vehicles to build up generational wealth or family wealth and help them out
I just have three quick questions. You
Anytime I place someone on Mr
Here, let me see if there's anything else I can do
Some people really wanna set themselves up for retirement, maybe create an update for their kids or travel more, something like that
So we just arrived today, so that's one
That's awesome. That's awesome. And would you go to Paris you think? Would you bring your family along too? What would that be like?
Beautiful. Cool. I'll lock it in here and we'll send you a calendar invite and we'll get everything ready to go. Okay,
And even just doing it makes you feel good
All right, let's do it. What time zone are you in?
So what I mean is I would continue to do more Airbnbs if I got leads cuz I'm already the programs done
We don't require you to actually review the book or anything beforehand
Yeah, they do. I was just, I'm starting to daydream. I wonder, <laugh>, go
And then yeah, you're welcome Greg
And so one last thing required to do is fill out this little form for Mr
All right, sounds good. Thank you, man.
Okay. Five 30 here. Are you sure you could make that five 30?
What's the wait it should be Ls bf
Great. And so that 10:00 AM on Wednesday, is that something that will work for you?
So does 7:00 AM work for that?
We come up with, we're constant revising
Okay. Make you want. And Jerry, when you say <laugh>, keep yourself above water. What do you mean by that?
And I've made thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars just in Colorado right now
Oh yeah, I think so. I would be pleased. So alright, well
<affirmative> right now we've got hundreds of multi six figure Airbnb beers and dozens of seven figure Airbnb beers, <affirmative>
No, I mean we don't have a huge yard that need to take care of. But
I didn't even finished the course man
Awesome man. So Javon, what time works better for you? Actually really quick what time zone are you in?
I think I have a super solid idea of how we can help you get to the next level
And you're so optimistic and encouraging. I mean, you're perfect for this role. Thank you.
It's gonna be tough cuz it's Easter and pass over weekend, so I'm beyond swamped every 15, 20 minutes.
She's in a nursing home for good
Do you want me to share it?
Why is doing that? Why is that a top priority for you?
Do you think that at all it'd be valuable to just pick his brain and see what he's got going on?
After that I'll try to stash up some money
Does that ring a bell at all?
You could potentially work with some of our coaches at a much higher and ongoing level
I'm sorry. Sorry, your family. Hold on.
So it's just kind of spur of the moment type of stuff
But these chicken barns, we bought this farm It's a pretty good deal
And so you have my cell number in there and you also be introduced
So you'd wanna be clearing that to replace that W2 income
Wow. Wow. What you guys have been busy with the property, the house you guys are basically fixing up for now? Yeah.
Okay. We have a 9:00 AM and 11:00 AM open on Tuesday.
The arbitrage strategy is, let me see, just to make sure that I'm clear on it
Yes, we do have one slot oak on Saturday at 10:00 AM
Nice, nice. So lemme ask a couple questions. Does he live in that area?
Me. Oh yeah, yeah. A hundred percent. $10,000 in residuals a month.
Sure. We have cash for the Airbnb stuff. I'm not worried about that part of it.
Yep, I can do Tuesday at four 30.
It makes sense. Yeah. But lemme ask,
But that money in addition to my $700 is all my profit
So I'll just ask you questions now
We call a lot of our students and oftentimes our numbers get marked as spam as well, so we get it <laugh>
So I'd have to write everything down cause I have a lot of questions, man
Thank you so much for asking
Hello? Yes, Paola, can you hear me boss? Yeah, I hear you fine
Okay. Yeah. Is there anything that's holding you back from scheduling a time?
You got it locked in there.
Subtract out what you paid the landlord for rent, which is 1200, you're at the end and pure profit
Kind of slow, but it's been Okay
I gotta learn how to scale with my particular house
I think that the only way to truly succeed is to just fricking quit
But I mean I haven't really started just cuz I don't know, I needed a little bit more money to do that
Yes, I want to be financial, financially free and help the people around me obtain that.
Let's go one. Do you know how long this call will be?
And so I won't be starting from zero
I'll go ahead and lock in that time slot for you right now and I'll make sure to let Mr
Does that ring a bell at all?
He does own some of them <affirmative> but he, he's a fantastic guy to talk to
I mean in Great Falls, are there any ins or hotels or anything in that town?
I haven't really checked but I haven't, I've been paying everything off on time and everything.
Tuesday. How about Tuesday at 5:00 PM five to
Yeah, that's fine man. That sounds good.
Okay. And would your wife be able to be on the call? It seems like she might be doing the Airbnb business with you.
So if you're not able to show up to the call focus just randomly cancel or NoShow something like that
Justin still with me? Justin, you there?
It's amazing. It's like I'm always looking to buy houses, so I'm always up on my credit. It's like seven 80.
Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off there
And I appreciate you for opening up
It looks like that's all the context that Catherine needs to figure out what's best to you
And really just a reason why we do that and that's in place is just obviously we wanna protect our executive consultants' time
Got a lot of pools. Yeah. Got a lot of pools. Got a lot of women. Not a lot of clothes.
I'll go ahead and lock that in for you for four o'clock each later today and send over the calendar invite as well
Well if I know how to do something <affirmative>, I don't mind sharing knowledge
Are you familiar with the rental arbitrage?
So in a perfect world, no boundaries
Let me just pull up and see what we can do
So I can just have you review that for the call
Yeah, let me tell you a story
So we're out here in actually a hotel resort
So it looks like we're locked in and I'll make sure to let Mr
Yeah, no, that's what it seems like
Oh sorry, just cut out for a sec.
Man, this is Thomas. We spoke briefly for a few minutes earlier this morning. Why you were eating breakfast B, B formula. No,
Yeah. And then just press save.
I think it may have come through on our side
And then, like I said anyone I place on Matt's calendar, just make sure you watch that important pre-call video
Oh no, I always want to be successful
And the only other thing is he just makes sure that everyone I place on his calendar washes a very important pre-call video beforehand
I mean, what would you do with that type of income? What would change for you personally?
So I'd be trying to sustain that without taking steps backwards is the tough part
It would be fine, I guess
Oh, there you go. Just curious, where are you gonna travel with those points?
A lot of people are busy
Perfect. Cool man. And then what's your gross annual income, the number you'd be able to actually verify with the tax return from last year?
All right my man. Cool. Sounds good. Let's do it. What time zone are you in?
<affirmative>. Gotcha. And is that the real goal or is that the, You're the smartest person. The entire world goal.
Right? Yes. Yes. You wanna hurt
So all that has to be done in the morning
Well, I'm 66, my wife is 64
Ah, right. Yeah. Okay. Sounds good. Sophia. We'll talk on Friday. Okay.
I'm trying to see which money is gonna make more money, has more potential to make more money, more income.
That's awesome. Tell me more about that. What would that look like?
So I wouldn't worry about it
Yeah, what I've always liked numbers and shit like that, but I never went into finance
And I, while I am a salesman, I do a lot of engineering functions
Okay. And that works for both of you guys?
Sounds good. You said 12:00 PM?
What does that mean to you?
And there's a lot of things
The second thing they look at typically annual income
And so that's really what I do here
I'm sorry, what was your question?
A hundred dollars compared a hundred dollars compared to their normal 1000
Yeah. So for you, what does success look like for you with Airbnbs?
Okay. All right. So any emergency he call me. All right. Okay then.
Fishing? I've actually been fishing with my mom before, but we never caught anything.
Yeah, the rest is call will probably be on for another minute or so and we'll be done.
So I was actually starting to get back into all of it just cuz time's starting to free up again
And that's actually the reason for the call today
So I'm allowed to hook you up with some free resources and help you out in any way I can to make that happen
I'm in Mountain Standard out in Arizona.
If you have a W2 then yeah, or if it's 10 99 that works too. Either one.
Dang. I mean, how are you doing right now?
I've got a full blown operation
Is there any time on Monday that you'd possibly be able to squeeze in a 60 minute phone call?
I've been like reading other things
She's actually just partnering with landlords and homeowners that she doesn't even know and splitting the profits with them
Do you wanna stick to that? Oh, after one o'clock
Okay. Do you want to a morning time? I got a nine or a 10:30 AM
But anyway and I just started really want to really want to dive into it a little bit and see what it's all about
Where am I? Laptop, What do I online or
And then one thing that'll be super helpful and Mr
Typically it is a thousand dollars time slot
Okay. Oh yeah, that's good. Expenses are low. And then how much cow do you have available or have access to put into deposits on properties?
It's gonna be vital in helping you get way beyond 150 K a year with Airbnb
Because what we have on our team is we have full-time executive consultants
Cause that just wouldn't be fair to you
And you got the correct email address just to make sure you have that or
Cause typically it's a thousand dollars time slot
Okay. What's the guy's name? Noah. What's his name again? Noah what?
So if you're not able to show up to the call focus, you just randomly cancel or nohow something like that
But if not, okay, I'll just give this to someone else
We literally have a guy and he, he's middle of the road
How does 1:00 PM Eastern work for you on Monday?
So I want a multi-family unit and then I'm also wanna get more into investing into the stock
I just wanted clear that up for the quick <laugh>
So the last thing I'm required to do is just fill out three questions here on this form so that Mr
I was curious, what's your motivation behind all this stuff? Why work on all this stuff?
I'll send over the ebook to you
Obviously family emergencies aside, but you guys won't be driving or have to be actively working or doing anything else like that, right?
Okay, let me see if I can pull up, I dunno even know if we have a company PayPal account
And they bring in over a hundred and the 120 to 150,000 every month
What goals do you have set for Airbnb?
That it's just not some gimmick that it works for some but not for all
Yeah, if it would make sense and just get any of his questions answered at the same time
And with that said, is speaking with one of these expert Airbnb consultants on our team
So she's kind of filled in cause I know she's not on this call here
Yeah, so 5 45 is, it's a little tight, but I actually wanna be sitting down so she has my undivided attention
Okay. And while you pull that up, you said that your current annual income is about 85,000?
Maybe three, four years? Three, somewhere between three to five years I think would be a good timeframe
And how much do you guys expecting to be able to bring home each month in cash off that property?
Stop talking to my dogs man
Would you end up helping people around you learn Airbnb as well?
And so it sounds like you basically, in a perfect world, you're making as much money as you want
I mean, of course not. No.
So actually unfortunately I'm only allowed to book these appointments out about 48 hours in advance
Do you remember spending about a thousand dollars with us on the BNB formula course a while back?
It's called How to Become Financially Independent on Airbnb without Owning Any Property.
Okay. And what is your gross annual income, like the number you'd be putting on your tax returns last year?
Okay. Why are we doing it?
I think that's one of the smartest business moves I've seen made of any other program outta here, man, that, that's brilliant
Real estate? Hell just keep pumping it into real estate,
Okay, let me check my, Hey, have you seen my wallet?
Okay. And so were you potentially looking at Airbnb as a way to get that going a little bit quicker?
So I wouldn't even mind buying it again and purchasing again if you wanna send me a link and stuff ever to come in
Do you want me to share it?
The company policy is the hundred deposit
But <affirmative>, I might be able to just waive the fee for you here and just do it for you free of charge
And once you're on that 10 K range, dude, give me a text, tell me that
Dude, that sounds like an amazing plan creating your own resort and natural living, which I'm a huge fan of as well
The newest vehicle I own is a 2003
Yeah. Hey Tyler, question for ideally, how many hours a week would you like to be working to have that financial freedom?
Awesome. So for sure be able to go through that video, take some notes.
You're a real estate empire man
And so once I get the other rental property it just be a smooth transition to a Airbnb
Now people typically don't purchase a book about a business opportunity like this unless there's a specific result they're looking to get to
It's affecting my ability to help myself
I got 'em all paid up, but now Okay, cool
You wanna pull up your calendar for Monday and just tell me what you got going on
Okay. All right. The number is 4 7 8 2 0 0 2 0 6 3 0 6 5 9 1 8.
And so that's really hurt us through this winter time just with everything
It just dropped it, Was it a six 50? I think it's like a 600 Paul.
Seven. And then, Okay. And then what was your gross annual income last year? Like the number you'd be putting on your tax returns?
Hey, Alex. My name is Cooper. I'm with Bmb Formula on Brian Page's team. How's your Friday treating you?
I mean, you'd be in a pretty good spot then
And I'm 67, so I'm not officially in the workforce in a traditional sense
And what's your gross annual income at the number you'd be putting on your tax returns last year?
So hey they can get almost 15 bucks at Wendy's now
Yeah. It should be a good time. Have you been to that island?
We hope to really knock it outta the park
So what's your credit score right now?
Plaster, a couple smile across their faces.
Yes. Sorry, I totally butchered that. <laugh>, that's what that is.
And it is gonna maybe sound silly here, but we actually have your name in the system
I could do the four, I could do either one. That would be fine.
We're part of the student success team and these guys are,
Well, that's all the context that Ms
And they're basically gonna lay out exactly what needs to happen in order for you to get results
So if you got there 10,000 a month, residual passive income, I mean that sounds like more of a stepping stone for you
I can definitely get a hard copy sent out to you and you can read over that
Typically would recommend between five and $10,000 just to get started with this
Yeah. Not just so we know what's available. Okay, cool. Yeah. Yeah,
So I'm guarantee you, if anything, I will make the time for it at three o'clock
And I know you mentioned spending more time with family and stuff like that, maybe just having a little bit more free time
So now we do a much more high touch one, one coaching with people who are doing six, seven figures at Airbnb
I can mean there's better times of the day for me
So if you go ahead and just pull up your clock app on your iPhone
I've been doing it for five years
So if you can just go through that, take some notes, jot down a couple questions, there is some huge stuff in there
What does Wednesday look like for you?
But I mean that's really mainly just because they weren't able to get started
Yeah, it looks like we could do something on Friday.
So let's call you on this number, not on your phone number
Let's do it. Let's do it at 1230 on Monday.
But basically you told me Donnie and it sounds like you're kind of already in the real estate business a little bit
Would you just be able to watch that before you speak with him this evening?
And so we don't have a full year under our belt
I'm an alumni so I like to roll up my sleeves, man
Cause that would cover the court of my bills and allow me to live a little comfortably
Yeah, I understand. Do you have my current email?
I don't really know. I know.
Would that be an appropriate time for you?
And I guess another couple of thousand for my sister
And so one of the reasons you're interested in Airbnb is like, man, this could start becoming a regular thing.
Okay, that makes sense. And so if you didn't have Airbnb to start bringing the income what would you guys do for retirement?
And I could definitely connect you with someone on our team that could definitely help you figure out some answers to those questions
It was a while back, so it's like a really thin blue and white book
So I'm just gonna finishing the information in here and I'm gonna send you a calendar invite in just a few minutes to that
Thank you. I appreciate that <laugh>. Cause I wanted it and I guess just hurrying and whatever. Yes, we want it though.
Know you're a hundred percent right.
And what are you at now? What are you clearing right now with your Airbnb business?
Cause she is, she's amazing at what she does, especially,
And the reason why we have that policy in place is obviously we want to protect our executive consultant's time
Correct, correct. And tell her that I'm leasing the actual land for five 30 per month. So anything above that is cash flow.
Just hey, can you renegotiate the payment system? Can you renegotiate the terms on buying equipment, Brought an additional 70 grand
I'm glad it worked out for you, man
So it's set up on our side and that spot's reserved just for you and the consultant
I'm the guy that's in the studio doing all the vocal recordings and all that stuff
I have to take a look at the calendar first, but how's that sound, <affirmative>?
I think you should be good to go
Getting to know you today and enjoy the rest of your weekend
Let's go with probably we could do 11.
I can point you down with each of those
So if you started an Airbnb business, would there be anyone else involved in helping you out? Like your spouse or a partner?
You could be doing all of that
Yeah, that's awesome. I love that. And why is that specifically, I mean, why is that important to you?
What will be the focus primarily just to get me moving forward on the b b stuff?
So Travis, I'm excited to see how the call goes to you
Yeah, I've got a JSR 1333 gmail.com.
That's all I know. 20, 23 I won't be leaving.
The biggest obstacle I would love
Yeah, I still work a regular job.
And so we took a look at what we would consider our bottom of the barrel students
But cuz you can do things at the higher level but again, everything costs money and you have to go into it
And the goal would be to use that as an Airbnb as opposed to a monthly rental
So is there any reason why you wouldn't be able to make that call on Monday?
And so right now, you know mentioned 30 60 K, which is a great starting point of bringing in income from Airbnb
24 K. Okay, so you're about a seven hundreds credit score and 24 K income?
I mean, to me, I love making a lot of money
Night. I hear ya. Right. Cause the duty calls at that point you're kind of at the mercy, at mercy of when the business comes.
I don't have the ability to book that far in advance
And that's within an 11 month period. You say pretty good
Thank you so much for asking, man
I've got some stuff in the afternoon
If you had a billion dollars and that's like, it's obviously a very big goal
Wow, okay. And are you hoping to put them in a private school from the start?
But what it is with that is it says I'm a done and anything about Dun and Bra Street,
I've been doing the therapist for about 10 years and I've been in the hospital for about 20 years total now
Two o'clock. All right. You sure?
I personally don't have access to your payment information to keep that pretty unlocking key, understand being the company
Oh no, no, we moved across the country. We don't live in the house anymore.
So Kentucky, let me just, I'll look this up really quick
Cuz one of 'em is just a one bedroom Airbnb and the other one's a three bedroom, two bath house
So you guys definitely looked out with that one
So there's always stuff to learn from other people plus the stuff we're learning on our own
Good. Good, good. How are you? I'm sorry.
You, Yeah, but I know you didn't call for that, but I was just saying I just wanted to bring that to your attention
Okay, Awesome. Yeah, it doesn't sound like you would stop there though. You definitely keep climbing.
Sure. How do you spell his name?
I've actually gotten the green light from Brian to hook people up with some free materials and stuff like that to make that happen
And current income. If you were gonna say what you take home in a year between everything you do.
There are things that I wanna do that all keep working.
And if you got 10 K a month, would you stop there?
Yep. Gotcha. So you have about maybe 5,000, is that in cash?
Yeah, and it sounds obvious but I just talk to a lot of people and it really does change for a lot of people
Is that something you'd wanna do?
All right, beautiful. Tell me what you have available.
I can get her to travel around with me
But question for you, do you, Go ahead, Dr
Gotcha. Are you worried that might happen?
The bucket list. That's awesome. Would you get Airbnb there? Would you stay in local places riding motorcycles?
How may I help you sir?
So all of which have personally done six or even seven figures with their personal Airbnb businesses
Gotcha. So, okay, that makes sense. Okay.
Let's see. Can you do anything earlier than that? We typically don't book these out past like 48 hours so we can squeeze something in
Yeah, my trucking business does really good and I'm able to live a pretty decent life with that
So for that property you closed on or you guys said you just got by the lake
Okay, can you help me look for it? Oh, I'm so sorry
Enjoy the rest of your weekend here and we will talk to you this week
We're just trying to expand into the property income, but think my nephew actually did own one at one time
I mean, is that something you'd wanna do?
So if you can't show up to the call completely focused, you just randomly NoShow or cancel or something like that
Well, and J just give you a little bit of an idea of what we've seen from just the bottom of the barrel students
Well, it's based off what we've seen with getting leases
This one last thing required do is spell a little form
However, in certain cases I do a thousand is, yeah, they charge about a thousand dollars for an hour of their consulting
Think again, my reluctance at the time was just it all of a sudden seemed like it was kind of a high risk thing
I work from seven to three though, so I don't get home until around 4:00 PM I'm headed home now
Become financially independent on Airbnb. Remember that?
So <inaudible> everything, <inaudible> going and got this little base income
They work directly with Brian Page himself
Okay. Yeah, no I appreciate that.
Okay. Yeah, you can lock me in. Will they give me a call?
So time wise, it's just a matter of what's a higher priority
Oh, okay. Yeah, go ahead and get that done. And then we'll what? I have the questions.
And so currently you said you're in the nine to five, you wanna make just a ton of money, unlimited amounts of money
I don't know, it just looks beautiful on the picture, so it's a place I'd love to go.
But you know what, I'm open for anything
Sounds good. Now the last thing here,
And like I said, please make sure you can take some great notes there
Yeah. And to be completely honest with you, the book is
Jackson has all the contacts he needs to figure out the kind of leases you can get going
I can even put you in touch with one of our guys on our team is actually going to clear about 1
You can just run around in your RV with things doing mostly autopilot and maybe take a little bit of the headache away
So if you're not able to show up to the call just randomly cancel or no-show something
So Carlos, dude, I am super excited to see how the conversation goes
I even downloaded Airbnb just to get an idea of the price and all that in the different areas.
I probably stuck it somewhere to carry it in a bag
And I don't wanna make any commitments to you
I needed to take a look at the availability first, see if there's something that we could do, but how does that sound?
Okay, that makes sense. And then out of that three 50 to 400, how much of that's passive versus active?
So it's kind of changed a lot of my perspective on things
Central, okay. Okay. So it looks like one of our consultants may actually have some time later today would 12:00 PM or 1:00 PM work?
I run three HVC businesses and pulling my hair out today
So that would be, let me do the math here. We have one property, two properties for that would be eight properties.
Wednesday. Wednesday. Yeah, Wednesday mor Wednesday morning, man. Wednesday
I just wanted to triple check there just cuz we do have a policy to charge a hundred dollars cancellation fee for these appointments
Okay, so about a year from now. Why so long?
Typically it is a thousand dollars time slot
And also knowing what are actually the next steps
Oh my god, I think I start flipping the property, start off with one. I'd be trying to get Airbnbs everywhere in different states. <laugh>,
For youmail.com. Casey pool y mail.com. Okay. Yes. Awesome. I'll shoot you over a calendar invite here and get you set up, okay?
I don't know. No, I would say no unless I changed my lifestyle.
All right, man. Enjoy your Chick-fil-A
No, that would be a 10. I mean, if I'm gonna spend an hour on a call, I'm gonna definitely be engaged, <laugh>, taking notes, everything.
Are there Airbnb around? Yeah, no, no, I get it
You know what? To be honest, almost anything
And then just kind of few things here before we wrap up, Mr
The only thing I have in the morning is at 11:00 AM I can also do something in the afternoon.
Okay. Yeah, definitely. And do you guys know what level of income you need per month to be able to be comfortable retiring?
And so I pissed away a good bit of a period of time and it's like, well, this is not good
That's not bad. That's not bad at all dude.
Did you mind helping me fill that in real quick? It's just three quick questions
If you could send me a text after your conversation and let me know how it went and how it helped you
Okay. Was it less than 40,000 though?
So I'm actually allowed to hook you up with some free resources to make that happen
I said I feel like I'm kind of getting a better understanding of where you guys are at right now
And you be back and get into Airbnbs and start cash flow like crazy
This is Thomas with b B Formula from Brian Pages team
Awesome. <affirmative> really cool. So you, you'd get that house and would that be quite an upgrade from where you're at now?
So what do you think there?
So what's your credit score at right now?
Hello Crick? Yeah. Hey, you there?
Thousand dollars a month if you were able to convert
Does this for the times we have available, we have four o'clock on Friday or we have 11:00 AM on Monday
And you said you've been doing that for, you've been that for years? 12 years.
Cause that's one of my big, big pleasures
We've always dream at doing that since we were teenagers and we just never done it
So it looks like I have a calendar up here from one of our consultants
This whole Airbnb thing is on my mind
What time? I don't really know
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Maybe I'd buy a boat. There you go. I'll buy a boat and put it on the lake.
Might have even been an ebook titled How to Become Financially Independent on Airbnb
But honestly man, you don't need to have any sort of prior experience
Not any time soon, but here near future. Yeah.
All right, so it looks like we've got you scheduled with Mr
<laugh> resources to build this awareness to build the different businesses that me and my family are thinking about and to really scale this
It's long term or if it goes good it can be long term but if not then it's just not what it's gonna be
Okay. Awesome. Do you guys get out much as far as travel goes?
I'm curious for you, Oh, well, what made you feel excited about Airbnb in the first place?
All right, fair enough. And Jack, which time zone are you in?
And then Raymond, just a few more things before we wrap up with this call
What I would need to know is how do I go about setting up a successful b and b business, <affirmative>
Just both together or actually personal.
So we always talk in terms of net with Airbnb that's low,
I'm willing to go through that kinda why I said that
Just start building up my Airbnb and start working on other flows of income.
I mean, I guess really pass passively, I'd want somewhere around a hundred cause I could still be a real estate agent
Just wanted to triple check there that you're good for that time
Cause she talks about that too all the time
Yeah, I did well with it
But typically you'll sign a lease with them
Obviously the larger you get, the more apartments that you're dealing with, obviously the higher it would be
I think so. She's off on Mondays and Tuesdays, so Oh, that's, so Monday, Tuesdays a good thing. So Monday is the 13th, correct?
She's actually our top executive consultant
And they can land exactly what needs to happen in order for you to get results
Well that should be all the contacts that Mr
So he's gonna net like $25,000 a month
So ballpark range, what's your credit score at right now?
And the biggest obstacle is just this figuring this stuff out with the credit you have
I just want them to stop working 24 7
He's not part of Airbnb itself
I just don't want to, don't wanna waste anybody's time
Let me look here. Yeah, let me open this up here tomorrow. I've got a one 30 and a three o'clock.
Typically we found that the folks who are still having success but are bottom of the barrel students just doing the bare minimum
Actually on our team, we've got full-time executive consultants
And what we found is that the vast majority of them never ended up getting any success
And yeah, I'm off and running, man
Yeah. No, I would definitely be a 10.
You're really, you're in the situation you don't wanna be in anymore
They regularly charge a thousand dollars just for a single hour of consulting
Now are you at 11:00 AM I wanna make sure that that still works for you tomorrow
Well, the reason I'm calling, don't worry, I'm not here to sell you something
But I think that zero to one is the hardest part
It is mandatory, takes just 20 to 30 minutes
And so having an understanding is the less that we do, but the more money we make you're taking back your life
Yes, I did order a book but I don't think I ever received it.
And so Airbnb has a massive need for hosts
And they can lay out exactly what needs to happen for you to get results
Okay, sorry I cut out for a second
I'm not sure who this is, man.
I've jumped on every opportunity I think I've ever saw, but I'm not sure if I failed them or they failed me
I hear you. Well let me tell you a little story that
So we'll get you in for that time
I hate if you'd ever have to pay that
But I'll tell you what man, we actually have some full time executive consultants on our team here
So before I try this again? Yeah. Six. I'm gonna read back everything just to double confirm. So card number, The card number here is 4400-6614-7097-5019.
No, no, I would love to do that. <affirmative>. I wish I could, but I can. Right now it's just struggling a little bit.
I'm gonna get this in here
And I knew it was always coming
Yeah. Yeah. Mr. Butler know that you guys can both be on there.
I can do after four o'clock my time. So anything after 1:00 PM for you guys are for
I mean three months come back, whatever it takes
Wednesday at 1230 I'll be sitting in front of my laptop
I'll be really honest with you, my biggest obstacle for me moving forward right now is this man that I'm married to
Not saying we have to use it but do you have some credit lines as well, some credit cards, business credit, anything like that?
Honestly, it's just basic knowledge, basic information
But it feels like, I mean we're fairly new, we're a couple years into it now
Okay, gotcha. Yeah, that's a bigger
A couple years. I don't know. Do you have the date in front of you? I'm guessing you had
He's got a free spot on two o'clock on Saturday
So for you, usually people don't invest a thousand dollars into a course unless there's a specific result they're looking to get to <affirmative>
Nah, she's just helping she raising the kids and helping me with the Airbnbs and everything.
About. Okay, cool. And if you got to that point, say six months a year from now, at that point, what would you do?
I mean has it been since you essentially got the course, you just been not able to dive into it because of that?
Okay. What are you guys doing now or what are you doing?
Okay. I think I, Yeah, I got it.
Yeah, it was I think September, October of 19 maybe.
So yeah, Ls, BF G P
Tons of group coaching, things like that
Okay, cool. You want me to break down how that call would go so I can find some time in their calendar?
I'm gonna be a concierge in a nursing home
I don't even know if I still have it or if I download it or what
We can just get you booked in real quick
Oh, we got one guy who's a coach for us, name's Justin
That would be a better question for our executive consultant
I was, So how you currently I was making 700 a week with caregiving. Gotcha. That's what I demand.
Yeah, I'm gonna do for 12 tomorrow. Is that
Jot down a couple notes here
Six Chicka sauces. That's impressive. <laugh>.
You can take that extra passive income and then put it into another one and then keep building it up.
Right now things are pretty tight, especially since we're trying to get at least one Christmas gift per kid this year <laugh>
Next question? So here's what I can do for you
This watches a pre-call video we have, it's like 30 minutes
So would you mind helping me take down some notes on that form really quick?
You always obviously want to grow to 10 K, maybe even go beyond 15
You obviously can get creative with it
It only made the people you work for money, it only made them better
And for you, I think honestly one of the best things that could help you is on our team
Okay, gotcha. So is your interest in Airbnb also some of the time freedom that you'll typically see with building an Airbnb business?
Yeah, I totally understand. And was that a while back?
And just, so the way this works, super simple
But yeah, so far, I mean I think every unit we have is profitable
Okay. Do you wanna pull up your schedule for this coming Monday, the 21st and just take a look at what you got going on?
Does that ring a bell? You remember? That was
Just wanted to triple check because we do have a $100 fee that's for reschedules, cancellations or just flat out for these appointments
So I'm curious what got you interested in Airbnb in the first place?
Well, let me tell you this and just give you some context and let you know what's been going on last year
Okay. First question is what's your credit score?
Everything that it was hyped to be sounded good to me, but it's like I got nothing so far
Yeah, she'll go ahead and call you.
I can do it today, actually. Today would be better than Monday or Tuesday.
Sounds like it sounds potentially good. Yeah.
<affirmative>. Okay, I'll go for that.
Sometime in the afternoon on Thursday would probably work fine
So to replace that income is that first goal
These guys are ranked getting paid <inaudible> for single 60 minute consulting session
I don't have anything left for the rest of this weekend
We found they just worked about two to three hours per week and would get about one new property every 45 days
Gotcha, gotcha. Cool. And then what does your afternoon look like tomorrow? Do you wanna just pull up your calendar for me, see what's going on
Is that something you'd wanna do?
Because that's what I make from my regular job.
These guys are literally the best in the business
<laugh>. I'll be like, Oh, okay. I don't know if this
Great. And is there any reason at all why you wouldn't be able to make the call? Because honestly,
Well, I wanna try one of those software management apps next go multi-platform, get more automation going
Well, I'm already making about $10,000 a month just off of my couple rentals that I have. So
So yeah, it would mean everything
I think it was kind probably one recent, but I think I did it a while, not too long ago.
At the end of the day though, it's like it's the action
So it looks like our executives are booked up through Tuesday, so we do have the two spots open on Wednesday
So at the very minimum, five 80 just to cover just the land lease for the manufacturer home, that's all
Those are the type of folks that actually succeed far more with this sort of thing
So if you're not able to show to the
Okay, cool. You want me to break down how that call would go if I can find some availability in their calendar?
So if you had three, that'd be about $4,500 a month
Just before I lock it in here, can you a hundred percent make 1:00 PM on Wednesday?
All right, do Sam. Thank you.
Okay. I get you penciled in and we'll go ahead and what's up?
So instead of $2,000 a month income, I'd be looking at $3,500 a month income
I really value you being able to commit to that
Cuz that's what the Airbnb was saying
They work directly with Brian Page himself
I'm kinda like at home by myself most of the day
So curious for you, Mike what kind of made you feel excited about Airbnb?
And then you mentioned the inheritance as well
Yeah, no problem there. So gonna be on a phone call or is it a zoom? Is it
Okay, gotcha. So about 10 K months that it'd be kind of step one in the process?
Yeah, yeah, that's the best one for me.
He'll likely be giving you a call from a four 80 area code
I look forward to hearing how it goes for you
Take some of that and get another one
It'll be a phone call. Matt will call you at 8:00 AM
And that's not grocery money or you gotta pay bill on Friday, right? That's money you could set aside if needed for the business
That's what I found in my experience
So I mean it's kind of <affirmative> different question there
And I'm not looking to sell you anything I'm just on the student success team
Not entirely, but I don't want it to be in jeopardy and there's nobody, I'm not married
So what is it that you do for work? Right now
So it's definitely, it's good, it's something I'm interested in and based on the era that I'm in
Watching myself be blessed and watch some of the older people
And then about 40 K in crypto
Yeah, well I'm super excited to see how it goes
Brian Page asked me to give you a call and reach out to see how you were doing on your Airbnb journey
Probably about 45 minutes. And if in Eastern time here as well. Yeah, I put in Eastern, so 9:00 AM Eastern.
Oh okay. Three years since I moved here.
I also don't have a coach or a mentor
And then later on in that year everything was back booming
You talking about take home after all my expenses?
Well it sounds like for you, it's not really about the money
You know what I'm saying? With everybody dying, no survivors, you know what I mean? That's the equivalent of what it is
But first yeah, I would just so that I know, Okay
I'm not sure I understand the question. How am I getting to that 30,000?
I mean right now I'm 20 years old so I only have 21,000
I'm doing wonderful on man. Thanks for asking. Wally, do you remember getting Brian's course a while back on starting the whole Airbnb business?
Hey Carlos, this is Thomas with B Formula
And then I think they probably offers from the holidays
Recent. Congratulations on the recent retirement and thank
And we do have a policy because our executive consultant's time is so valuable
I was just looking for it the other day and then there it was
I'm the kind of guy, if I hit one time, I know success, don't have a date on it, I can do it again
Hey man, what's up? I'm good.
Of course. And I totally understand that. Life often does do that, does get in the way sometimes, doesn't it? <laugh>.
In 2021 I made, I also worked all throughout the summer
Cool. David do you have any other questions for me? Anything else I can clarify or are you good to go?
Right around 15. So is that one five?
What if we're on the call? It is not gonna cost us anything
Is that what we're going with this one? Is that what this leads to?
I know there is either way
Only reason I ask is the video is super important for you
We probably would have several thousand, but I'm not comfortable revealing that at the moment.
How do you feel that having an Airbnb business would help you get that?
Well, we have over a million dollars cash right now, plus other stuff, so that should be plenty.
So it's not like you already have one
Great. And I'm just gonna send you a calendar invite really quick. Could you accept that?
Do you know when you'll be receiving some of that?
All right, great. And Deborah, is there any reason why you wouldn't be able to make the call with Mr. Strat? No. Just, okay.
Yeah, so there'll be actually one or two things
And he already has 14 properties
It takes about 20 minutes or so
I mean, why is that important to you to be able to help them move with into your town with you family?
But in addition with school, sometimes I can get overwhelmed with that
What was the main reason you got interested in it?
You're the proverbial phone call that came out of the blue
And so you essentially don't need to go through the rental arbitrage material for the next few months
I am currently trying to get out of debt
I would say available outside of bills. Outside of everything else, I would say at least 2000.
Cause this could be incredibly valuable for you down the line
If you're not able to show up to the call focus, you just randomly cancel our no-show, something like that
Some people just came in here
It is a requirement to get on the call
I, I'm gonna have something prepared
Absolutely. Enjoy that warm weather out there, <laugh>.
Gotcha. How many credit cards do you have?
D as in David. I as in a apple, K as in kite, I as in a, T as in Tom, E as in elephant.
I haven't started anything on the Airbnb business yet, so that's why I put myself at it too
Can you just check on one thing for me? Can you check on Thursday at one o'clock if that's available?
Yep, yep. Show up to the call. 10 30 Thursday, no charge. A hundred percent
That's probably not a complete answer to your question, is it?
I mean you gotta put some money, but it's very little and it's all based on information
Got it. Well you were saying growing your Airbnb business would help you.
Even down to the maintenance and housekeeping
<laugh> will do. All right, bro.
And then experience, you're like, man I think I could start doing this. Cause yeah,
I like your energy and I really admire and respect your drive and your hunger for chasing after this
I'm in Pacific. I'm over in on the West Coast Pacific in San San Francisco Bay area.
And I know a lot of that
Oh, awesome. That's actually really great news, man, cuz that means you're actually in a pretty solid position to really start getting these Airbnbs.
I just bought another piece of property and I'm about to build a duplex where right now we're doing duplexes right now
Yeah, for sure. Yeah, man, just put me in the prologue and then I'll be good. That that'll be all I need. <laugh>.
Brian is the guy who wrote the book that he bought a few months ago and I'm the student success manager for him
So you can just kill it with this
William Butler and this guy's really, really good, especially at the finance side of things
Right. Okay, gotcha. And then what do you bring at home each year in annual income
Dude, honestly, you're a lot of people that I talk to so don't even feel bad
Do you know what it is?
So still trying to figure how to get it going
And so that's partly partly has been my issue
Cause it's my favorite part of the job is talking to students after we help 'em and just seeing their breakthroughs
Okay. I do have an 11:00 AM Pacific time.
Be giving back and helping your family,
Not gonna be very effective. Yeah,
I don't have no funds period
By the way, that does happen
So what do you think there definitely something you want to do?
So long term, in a perfect world, no boundaries, what was the ideal income you were hoping to get to?
That I'm not sure. I mean I think my max would be two hours per day. Oh,
Is that something you're struggling with right now?
Yeah. So go ahead and go to alarm.
So that was kind of an <crosstalk>
I literally just apply for a credit card today, so I get my credit card about a week from now
Helping me fill that in real quick
So do you know what your credit score is? Maybe last time you checked?
So just so that he's fully aware
Well, so here's what I'm thinking, Tyler, because on our team, we've actually got full time executive consultants
Tomorrow? I could talk late morning between 10 and noon. Does that work for you guys?
Last time I looked at it was like seven, 12, something like that
But I also know, I also know how it is
And then just lemme make sure I'm checking off all the boxes here for Mr
All right. Have a good night and we'll talk to you tomorrow. Okay?
So we do have a policy to charge a hundred dollars cancellation or reschedule fee for these appointments
And then let's to see if there's something that I really want to do
We could do a 4:00 PM Eastern or a 2:00 PM Would others work for you?
I have to take this call
<affirmative>. So you have some rentals already in Vacaville, right?
So a ballpark number here, but do you know what your credit score is?
Go ahead and send that through PayPal, then I'll talk to our team after that
Yeah, I've been here kind of listening to a little bit of it
What's the best time on Friday?
Right now I'm living with my mother-in-law, so I'm trying to get a place of my own as well as get this started
I mean, I'm just exaggerating to make my point, but <laugh>,
<laugh>? When I bought this particular one, I actually had three lined up, but the gentleman
At first it would just be me, cuz I'm close to retire, I'm closer to retirement, then he is
Some are up to 2000, but we'll just take 1500 as the example's sake
Now I have to look at their calendars first, but how does that sound so far?
I guess that's kind of something I've been realizing
I just at the point to where I just feel like I need something else, I need more
I wanna do this for you
Okay, so it looks like we actually have a 4:00 PM and a 5:00 PM open today. Which one of those work better for you?
That can help you get from where you are now to ultimately where you'd like to be
Well, I'll tell you a number of things
Three, the three o'clock could be a good thing. Okay. The three o'clock could work.
You understand what I'm saying? So
They're the ones that typically have the most success
Okay, cool man. Well initially what kind of got you excited about Airbnb?
And then within 12 months you're at $12,000 a month
Could you help me fill that out really quick?
Nothing you can tell me is gonna be too much
To take care of my mom? No, I don't know
I'm starting an air Airbnb business
Okay, so it looks like I'm double confirming here
My mom makes my wife happy cuz my wife's stresses too because she's got her own medical issues
Awesome, Brian. Sounds good. Well, it was great talking to you. I'll go ahead and lock it in and send everything over to you. Okay.
But dude, I gotta say I respect the hustle
<laugh> I don't know. <laugh>. You know what I mean? I'll still be me I guess, man.
I kind of started it and then we just kind of got busy
All right my man. Well, do you remember connecting a few days ago? I know you said you were headed out to church for Good Friday.
So that's essentially how it works
It might not be direct right at that moment, but down the road it does
If she want to get some of her questions answered too, that will probably be the best way to go about it
We can do so what we want
So I mean that's something that we've talked about
When I was doing, I got my broker's license
I can get you scheduled right now on the phone
I've been talking about it for a while
If I step off this boat, I'm not gonna go work at Taco Bell
Yeah. What do you think you would need help with or need to do for that?
How the hell let me make myself available for a couple minutes? How can I make this work? Right
Let's go ahead and schedule a call
And then, yeah, only reason I ask is the video is super important for you
And there's so many different ways to leverage the platform
Whether you just started the course or you already had five properties to see if we help you in any way
Wind turbines. Okay, gotcha. And so what's the goal there with $10,000 a month, what your primary goal would be to get outta your current job?
Yep. My name is Cooper, I work for Brian Page. Do you remember purchasing Brian's book a while back on starting an Airbnb business?
Rogers, is actually free at that time, so that's super lucky there
So we haven't spent enough time digging into your situation to know what's best for you
Something I don't have to put in a whole lot of hours
So tomorrow I've got between 1230, or excuse me, which zone you in? Actually, let's get that.
But ultimately to answer that question is I would like to make a decent amount, like 500 k plus
And she has all, well they had, I said, Well look, she drives all over creation and they don't show up
If I take the time to email that to you, will we watch it?
Yeah, for sure. Well mean, what would you do with that type of income coming? Would anything change for you personally?
Oh, okay. How is that for you?
It's a newness resort, it's a <laugh> resort for naturalist and natural living and things like that
That being said, I'll pull up our calendar here
And so you said you were in Houston, Texas, correct?
Is it a Zoom call? Am I gonna get a link or something? I'm just,
This takes about 20 to 30 minutes
Okay, so maybe not the best time to accept the calendar invite
Now. If you press add to calendar.
I used to be a teacher and I want to build a better life than that financially
Digital copy in terms of actual physical, physical course books, anything like that? It's all digital
And so it's just me, you so yeah
Yeah. Does it feel more like a business or more like a job?
Did he ain't answer? Did he answer?
Yeah, but you set me up for that call
You need to know the limits of the credit card.
Before a few minutes ago I thought you said it was a certain time period. How long is the call?
<affirmative> for me how much money people spend on college and university and a lot of that's a waste
And so does one thing I'm required to do
So once I have everything in place, then the capital is going to keep rolling in
Okay, well I've got a 2, 3 30 and a 5:00 PM Pacific time. Which of those is best?
I'm really wondering where the heck, Oh, well, this is a lesson learned
But I still need to go back and go over it to more
Yeah. Well it depends on the location. Do you have a specific location that you'd like to look up?
Sorry, could you repeat what it looks like?
Well now if I'm gonna place this, okay
Yeah, what would that be like?
Let's do this because this is a special case and I hear you
Well I think that I can go get the capital, like I said, I'm a small business advisor for marketing agency
Number you're good to go, you have to work? Anybody
It was great talking to you
<laugh>, <laugh>. It's been one muddy year and past two years.
You can kind of look at like a jump start
It's pretty cool, I guess just call you up and hook you up with some free resources or materials
So I'm not really looking to get out of my job and replace my income and work for myself
Oh yeah, I do mean yeah, I'm traveling just right now, just so I've heard doing some paperwork today
All right, perfect. My man. Sounds good. Well, I will go ahead and send you calendar invite. Does everything make sense?
That's all I need to figure out what will be best for you
So it'll just say a normal pricing for the year
He's gonna net $25,000 this month
So we we're essentially the asset managers for Oak Tree Capital
Oh well man, that would mean a lot for me at least
I work a lot and then I would find ways to enrich my life and those around me
I don't know what they would do, but it would be awesome. <laugh>.
I'll take it. Why not? I'll do it, I'm interested. Okay,
When I was with the union, I was making up a 70 a thou, 70,000 a year before taxes
Yeah, it'd be fine. Just a old Infinity or Nissan
They're ready now, Cooper. They're ready now. Yeah, they're ready now. I mean, I'm talking, I
So I don't have much money and my credit is not where it need to be at
I do see this as a serious opportunity in helping you
Cool man. And how are those going?
I do have anderson insurance gmail
So between all that I, I've been pretty busy and Covid construction market has just been ridiculously busy
Man, I can do it all.
And you took on a mortgage on a house 18, 20 months ago
But the few that did had really incredible success and are still having success
Yeah, yeah, for sure. <laugh>, we don't like to have jobs, we just have them temporarily <laugh> we we'll make time,
And if you've got to that Mark, you made thousand dollars a month, would you stop it completely? Would you keep going it?
So that means you can actually, okay, so then it's just kind of figuring out transportation
And then it's like, yeah, give us a call us sometime, <laugh> the website
I build, like I said, I invest build houses from the ground up
17 years. And what's your annual income with that?
Okay, so here's kinda my thought process
Okay let's do 10:00 AM I want to be focused on my work on the afternoon, so yeah, 10:00 AM then
Gotcha. Yeah we, we've just seen before you're walking the dog or you're on speaker phone driving, it's
And you said that helping people is one of the things you wanna do, helping family
Cool. Thanks man. Appreciate that. All
Every day growing up now every day
So I, I want to get in too much detail on it right now, but it's not the best job in the world
Years ago? It was a couple years back, right?
Yeah, I mean if you wanna do this, it wouldn't be too much of an inconvenience
She is one of the best, especially at helping people get started in the how and the mindful side of things
And what email address are you gonna send that to?
I'm doing wonderful. Christine, do you remember getting Brian's course ball back on starting the Airbnb business?
So usually people don't invest a thousand bucks into a course unless there's a specific result they're looking to get to
So just so that he is fully aware
All right. Which one? I got a 9, 9 30 and 10:00 AM or 10 30, excuse me.
Is that something you wanna take advantage of?
But, well, let me see. Hang on, let me check something real quick.
<affirmative> not something you always felt or something that's more important now recently?
We'll go ahead and lock it in here with Bridger on five 30 Monday Eastern time
Cause obviously you have business experience and you're able to think a business owner and operator which is huge advantage coming to Airbnb
I didn't know these people were looking at me and what I was doing
So most people don't invest into the course unless there's a specific result they're looking to get
But Brian Page, my boss, he actually has a lot of different programs
Let's give it a second to, All right, so it looks like you ran through
Rob Smith tomorrow at 1230 Pacific
Yeah. Do you have any passive income right now?
And then yeah, let's be over the phone
We have a couple slots from about 1230
Oh yeah. Hi, how are you?
The fact that you do that's admirable
And I'm sure that was per year, but I don't really need that yet
Could both of you a hundred percent be on the call tomorrow at four Central? We can conference her in
You invested in few different things and
Probably 15 minutes cause I was taking a small break around 2:00 PM after that it will be Thursday, but after four or Friday?
I was offered tax help, which I refused because I don't actually have anything going on with the business yet through Airbnb
I mean, they're literally the best in the business
Yeah. Yeah. 10 K a month. Oh yeah. I like it
Well, I did my little bit of research and find in looking into some places to do Airbnbs
That always puts a bad taste in people's mouth as far as mm-hmm
And so could you help me take down some notes for him so he has some context on where you're at?
So in essence, In essence, it's free
Will you be able to watch it before you speak to them on Tuesday?
Even if it's in stocks or crypto right now?
If I can just go ahead and find some time in their calendar
Within 12 months you'd be at literally 12 to $16,000 a month and just after the first year
I was interested in kind of just making a passive income or an additional line of income basically
I mean, they regularly charge about a thousand dollars per hour for their Airbnb consulting <affirmative>
It's it's called Jack Tally JC K T A L L Y at
I'm gonna send that over to you
Why do you, he'd be against you doing a hundred dollar refundable deposit, you get back?
I wanted to convert my existing rentals to Airbnbs
Do you have a ballpark number of how much available capital he has to help you do these deals?
You want me to share it?
I'm not sure if that's even in our program or not because I didn't even unpack it
Well don't worry about not getting started yet seriously, because that, that's totally normal
No, I can do that right away
And yeah, I'll send you over the video with that
I'm packing and I got a utility guys come out to the house
Of course not. No. If I schedule something with you, I keep my schedule.
That's what people want to do
And so it's probably take a little bit of work <laugh> to get there
Man, I bought the course a long time ago and just got life happened, Lost a lot of people and my health took full toll
If you're not able to show up to the call focus just randomly cancel or no-show, something like that
Tomorrow, and which time zone are you in?
So that's usually gonna depend on the actual property owner itself
Of course we just kind of started going so it takes time to get to do it
But we're, that's not the location that the business is gonna stay in
Okay, gotcha. Understood. Yeah, I totally get that. And a little bit different than obviously the long term buy and hold.
Two, okay. Do you know the available credit on there?
Yeah. But yep. We'll go ahead and lock you in for this call tomorrow, again for Eastern, and I'll send you a calendar invite right now.
So traveling is my number one thing I wanna do
Would 11:00 AM or 1:00 PM work better for you?
Bewa know you're fully committed to watching that video
If I could take home 2,500 a week or more, then yes that would where I would be at.
Brown is literally one of the best at our company and especially for people who have had bad experiences in the past
When would they like to schedule a call? Are they gonna just call me randomly or can you shoot me an email about that?
And I feel that I could enhance the industry, if that makes sense.
I'd love to help you out
I can hear that in your voice
So in a perfect world, no boundaries mean do you have a an ideal monthly income you're hoping to get outta something like this?
So I've seen it all over the board
And once you get that first one then it's like okay now the formula, the process, then it's just a matter of repeating that
No. No. It <laugh>. Why would I stop <laugh>?
What times are on Sunday? Cause I might be able to do Saturday, but I'm curious about Sunday
I've been here for about two months and passive income actually isn't my goal right now
They're about 7 40, 7 39, 7 40.
But sounds like you're available at four, so shouldn't be an issue for you
Well I value being good on that
Okay. I understand. Where do you think that drive comes from?
So you can talk to him on Monday and we can just go from there
Know what I mean? But I'm just, yeah, so it's just trying to, throwing around numbers potential
Perfect, perfect, perfect. Just wanna the right one. Thank you very much. No, I appreciate checking
All right. Do you want me to text that link over to you?
So just so that he's fully aware
And I'd have to take a look at their calendar first, but how does all that sound?
Awesome. And the best phone number for the executive consultant to call you on is one? We're on right now.
And so what that means is that within 90 days they've acquired their second property and they're now at $3,000 per month
So actually I'm looking at all my emails from you guys and boy do I have a lot of them
Okay, awesome. And then which time zone are you in?
So if I know it's Arizona, then I'll almost answer the call
So it's almost like keeping that not too high, not too low, but kind of not desperate, but that it, it'll get booked
Which email address are you sending it to?
Are you willing to show up to the call fully focused, no distractions?
And typically it is a thousand dollars time slot
Yeah, go ahead, Mike. We'll do that.
Okay. You can have five minutes.
I mean, you have tons of time on your hand
I can't do three. Well no, Yes, I can do three o'clock.
<laugh>. Yeah, I like that. <laugh>.
And then he's a little bit above that
I've also got a 1230 and a two 30 in the afternoon on Wednesday the second
No, I want to get out of the day to day
Cool. So for the car, for the a hundred dollars refundable deposit, does that have a middle initial on it?
So I'll probably do that then
So that please be sure to do whatever you need to do
Brown? Is it the one we're talking on right now?
So Joe, has your nephew seen the webinar that you went through?
It would just be vinyl in helping you get your first one to two Airbnbs up and running
Now, obviously if that's the case, that does require a higher level of investment
Cool. Where do you feel like the drive to collect those old cars, where do you feel like that comes from?
Smith know what we talked about a little bit on this conversation so he some context under where you are
If you had a 400 K by that point, would you have people come in, they'd be cleaning everything, doing laundry, doing dishes, cleaning the yard?
So I actually fill out this little form just so they have context for you
Yeah. That's a very good and attractive team. Yeah.
Yeah. Wait, quick question. What did the call, right, you say when I called,
I took it outta of my purse and let's see, it's, it's that in here
Don't know. I don't have a number, but lots
He actually just started about 12 months ago and he started with one property, two, three, and then he just secured his 14th property
Sometimes they're not even in the same country
But we do have a few executive consultants who that's more their field of expertise
So I've put more attention towards that
<laugh>. Yeah. Yeah, I really wanna help you out here so
Go deeper into it, maybe advise you a little bit on it
Paris. That's awesome. That's awesome man. Where would you go, go first in Paris? Where would you go see first?
What is the number that, Yeah, Brian says we
All right, Chad, it's been amazing talking with you
So to speak. You know what I mean?
I guess is this, I haven't finished the course, I haven't even started 'em yet
No, what was the question? I'm sorry. Like
Yeah, most definitely. And were you able to get started or speak to any landlords?
I'm gonna have you with Mr
Because it sounds like, dude, it sounds like you could freaking kill it with this
Seems like at least every other week at the minimum
So you can watch it on your phone or your computer or whatever you want to do.
And so you said you're interested in Airbnbs right now
Cause I mean that sounds like it's always been something that's been important to you
So the majority of the population, they don't have that opportunity
Yeah, I mean if I could get to five or 10,000 a month, that'd be awesome
So I know that I will be successful in that manner and I know that it'll be something that I would love to do
I'm sorry, say that again. What was this?
How you doing today? How you doing
I don't mind if you wanna just throw me on speaker phone, I can just talk at you a little bit here,
Do you have any personal credit cards?
So I can't do that Thursday unless I can do it at night
No, I have no idea. Okay. Totally.
Do you do D I B yourself?
No, tomorrow I have a training from nine to I'm not at my desk right now
You would keep scaling it if you could
Yeah, I'll text both of those over to you and I'll email them to you as well
That. Okay, so you would be
Thank you. We'll talk tomorrow than with Daniel.
Probably buying the furniture too, I think
And so if you wanna shoot me a text in there or you can also shoot me a text
But I don't have a life I'm not having any fun
I mean, everything would basically, cause this job is a work from home
Well it sounds like you, you're working on a lot of different things here
She could definitely get some value
But I'm selling a couple other assets that my parents have that we had equity in
Do you want me to share it? Okay,
And I'm just looking at getting five 50 for it, which is not too much
All of us. Hey. Hey Victor?
Okay. Where'd you say your name is?
Typically I finish up usually around four o'clock in the afternoon <affirmative>.
I need to be someplace that is warm all the time and I can have fruit trees and just do my thing
I don't even know right now
Not to cut you off, but you said that your credit score took a little bit of a hit. What? Where's it at?
And truly you can do it faster than that
But our team does invest on a large scale
Yeah man, I got you. If I can't make it, I'll make sure I reschedule it.
Can you hear me? Hello? Yes
And it would be vital in helping you to get your first one to two Airbnbs up and running
Yeah man. Y'all have my email right?
Yeah, I mean that's a lot of people I've talked to in the same position
Dude, I think you literally get two to three times as much
Okay, so it looks like I actually did find a few times that might be able to work
So creating that stability would mean a lot
I work during the week, so with my current sales job, I work Monday to Thursday basically the whole day
Donnie, okay. We've got the email, the D PTOs or pious <laugh>. I will
Oh yeah, I think I might 10.
If you recall, you got Brian's course while back on how to start an Airbnb business
Time. Got it. Just pulling up the calendar here. What does tomorrow look like for you?
Okay, awesome. Sounds good. And as of right now, as far as checking, savings, somewhat liquid investments, what are you dealing with?
But I do some unique strategies
It was great talking to you. Oh yeah, I've got, what's the email you have on file?
Question? Yeah, can understand. There's just a specific process that I go through to make sure that this makes the most sense for
12 minutes? Oh yeah, you can watch that.
So I'm sort of out there as the lone wolf trying to do everything, which is not possible
Do you understand what I mean? That's less,
Where do you want to get to?
Spending more time with family, nieces and nephews and stuff being their I don't know, Right
Yeah, sir. Does everything make sense?
No problem. I'm here to help. Text me or call me whenever
So it's about 40 hours a month
I'm looking to partner and stuff and use other people's money to keep doing it
So eventually I'm not gonna be cutting
Central time. Gotcha. Okay. I you're in central time. Gotcha. I'm just gonna pull up and see what times you have available.
<affirmative>. Okay. I mean, yeah, I would definitely be interested in talking to someone.
I don't, I'm not putting any of my money that's sitting there, I guess to work in my trade account
But if you just watch the video then no worries about that
And you pressed yes and you'll be good to go
So it looks like we are booked up for the rest of the day, but we do have some time slots open tomorrow
No space, It's just a underscore
Yeah but if they're busy I, You guys have my number? Oh you can call back tomorrow at any time. I'm a driver so
I'll also shoot you a couple texts here so you can text me if you have any questions
And then they just give them a tidbit, a 1% of what was talked about in the conversation
That's whether I want use it all. <laugh>.
I think a couple of 'em we're gonna sell so potentially I'll have somewhere around $70,000 from that in the next couple months
It's Cooper with Bmb Formula from Brian Page's team. How you doing?
Oh, I'd be a 10. <laugh>.
Cause I can be your direct contact here
Yeah, just gimme one second man. I'm getting in. I've got the move some stuff outta my way before I get in here. I,
I can watch it at night, go in and gimme something to eat and come back and watch it
Okay. I can do a one 30.
Well Andrew, I'm super glad you connected cuz instead figuring out if this still works and getting the right information
It was a while back, right?
Yeah, yeah. Saw the interview with him. So all that's good stuff.
So the latest I've got is I have a 4:00 PM on Thursday,
Why behind it? Is this a way to leave a job? Is this a way to start investing for the long term?
Yeah, Tuesday as long as it's earlier in the day. In the morning. That's good. What's the earliest time? Tuesday they could have
<affirmative> looking to talk to somebody again. How do I find you guys
I haven't done a whole lot with your guys' stuff
The first one is, do you know your credit score?
Just haven't had around my head around it
Gotcha. So yeah, tell me a little bit more about that. I'd love to hear what are you looking to accomplish with Airbnb?
Yeah, well it was just interesting me
And that being said, please be sure to do whatever you need to do to remind yourself to be on the call
Then I'll also shoot you a text on my cell mine as well
Seven 14. Okay. Also a ballpark here, but what's your current annual income?
And sometimes they don't even pay furniture, they just split the profits
Yeah, we can talk about year per month, per week. I think per month is usually a really solid number to drill down to.
Yeah, I'm definitely interested in that. I appreciate it.
You'd love to be hitting $6,000 a month in net income from your total business
So that would be my to tap more into the music side of what I'm doing outside of it
<laugh>? Yeah, I don't know. You say it's working here in Seattle, huh?
Ahead. We're out here in Arizona. So what time is it for you right now? Oh
Okay. And how much do you need to to be able to pay off those hospital bills
All right Mary, well I appreciate you taking the time
Bin WA so you can prepare for your call
So Diane is going to contact me or who's gonna come back and what are we gonna do?
He wouldn't need to be involved in asking questions or making decisions or anything like that. In regards to this
And like I said, if you could just go through there, maybe take some notes, jot down a couple questions
That's what I'm saying. Is that something you'd wanna do?
With my son and stuff. If I have it scheduled, then I can make sure someone's watching him so they can full attention.
I was like, wow, this is genius
They can't scam me if they can't get ahold of you
So I'm not, yeah, so I definitely, I got the proper leads
I just gotta fill out this little form so you might help me fill that in real quick
House spot, maybe it's on me
Okay, let's make sure check it's gone through our side and then okay, we got you in.
Your wife can be up to speed
I just base things off of things that I go through and what I see
And so my goal is to continue to expand it and do what I'm doing with even some other people
Somewhere between 10 to 20 ish, give or take. I guess we'll call it 50. I've have back access to
I'm super sad to see how it goes
Oh there is a balance on one of them, I forgot.
Yeah, we got, well I have had four kids before and she had three kids. She had three. So we got seven kids between us.
I include the things that I'm passionate about
And so if you gotta that place, Oh yeah, yeah
I've actually gotten together with two other friends we're very serious and very driven and had two ideas
Okay. Understood. And then is that a W2 job you're employed by someone or are you self-employed?
So usually people don't purchase a book like this or look into this investment opportunity unless there's a specific result they're looking to get
Yeah, so this is my work number, but I can send you over my direct line for my work number
Seriously, a lot of people haven't been able to get started yet
Just stop you from doing certain things.
Well that's a good goal to have that being able to travel to family and maybe be more into their lives
Do you have a decent amount of reserves or capital saved up right now?
Okay. I was not able to get him however, if we move you to Tuesday I will definitely get him Definitely get him on board.
Okay, awesome. Well would you like me to break down how that call would go if I can find some availability in their calendar?
When do you think you'd be able to get ahold of him?
So raising generational curses and stuff like that
I mean I can try. I just have
You can gaslight, I don't like, this isn't a comfortable thing for me to send money, so you just randomly called me
The only other thing here is that Mr
And the fact that you have that vision tells you something about you something special
Yep. F far as tb. H A K T A B R O T H E R N. Yep, that's it.
Well let's see here. So you said Wednesday in the evening would be possible.
<laugh>. Awesome. What does feel awesome mean to you?
Yeah, I've got several thousand dollars, so yeah, that I wanna put up
So that may be a fit if you are a fit for it
So it looks like you are finalized Mr
My tax return from last year I made 151,000.
I don't know. I want them to know how much I care and how much I love them.
But I can be back home by let's say five o'clock
So now I've actually gotten the green light by Brian Page here
So Freeman, perfect world, no boundaries
And then all of a sudden we have more
Nah, I'm definitely more the jungle. Yeah.
Perfect. Okay. Where were you guys? Will you guys just be at home at seven?
Oh, the only last thing before the call Mr
Do you mind helping me fill that in real quick? It's just three questions here
I just wanted to let you know of that and really make sure that that time did work for you
Yeah. Wow, that's amazing. Long have you been running these businesses for?
One second here. Let me go ahead and add an address here under your file. So go ahead and give that address.
Just that you have those unselfish motivators cuz I mean, you do need to be selfish too
It's basically as quickly as possible
That's the standard Brian has for the people who are gonna be actually helping his students out
We can move on from that
Yeah, I'm adding it right now.
And we're actually five star super hosts
So we actually are in the process of turning a townhouse into a Airbnb and purchased some of Brian's products
Gotcha. So what were you looking for with Airbnbs?
I'll pay you, What are you asking for rent? And then, you know, talk enough of 'em
It just takes about 20 to 30 minutes
They'll probably send you a text as well
Tool that you mentioned? Money. <affirmative>,
And you've been doing that for how many years again?
Yeah, I would say honestly I didn't mean for that to come across as question your goals and whatnot
Do you have an idea of the monthly income you'd be hoping to get to with Airbnb?
Well, the reason I'm calling you is I'm the manager on our student success team for Brian
You know what I mean? Yeah. It's close by and I need to try to get it, make it happen. So I'm ready from that perspective.
Let's go ahead and set an alarm on your phone right now for the appointment
Yeah, it sounds like that would just be a starting point for you
I, yeah, like I said, just a rough day
Yeah, I can make that three 30.
All right, Justin, I've got French X the letter X stream@yahoo.com. Is that the best email for you?
I'll probably do 15 to 20 grand <affirmative>.
Well here's the thing, it's a formula
Not somebody to come talk to me about something
You feel like you've already accomplished all your goals, you already have all the money. Oh,
Yes we do. Okay. Let's see. Would a morning time or evening time be better? You a Monday
We have on Monday, November 15, Monday we have a four or a or him or six available 6:00 PM available
I don't know, it would be more less than that
But what time zone are you in?
So what's like if you have your own business, what's your businesses annual gross income for the last two years
Well, these semi passive compared to something to replace my current W2 income, obviously is what I'm getting at
Well that's the smart thing to do
I live in Chief Hawaii here and I got, actually my bmb is on the other street opposite of my house
I'm just on the success team
If you help me do that really quick, just a few questions
And what makes you wanna get out of that?
Okay. And then between, you said you're doing 1600 a month between you and your wife, how much are you guys bringing home? An income
All right. I'll lock that in for you now. I've got Casey pool, is it gmail.com?
To be honest with you, if I started bringing in 5K a month, I'd probably reinvest in more properties
I don't where that comes from
If you were 20, 30,000, what would you do with that type of income coming in?
I I believe in the east.
Set it up now while I'm on the phone
Yeah, I'm gonna to 1230 or one 30.
We both have stressful careers, so definitely less stress
But Wow, that's awesome man. You'd retire your parents?
I definitely think anybody could do it. I don't know, it's just hard to find the places.
Right now another thing is, Oh my bad.
Yeah, it's Thomas with b B Formula. I'm Brian Pages team. How you doing?
I think I even looked at a couple 2,500 ones
I'm, the last time I checked it, it was like a 5 64
I don't know if maybe my wife got it or when we were moving
I grew up in the poor neighborhood so I would help out a lot of the kids that I grew up with.
So I'm curious for you be able to get started with Airbnb or what's going on
And if you wanna forward it, you should definitely forward it to her and she can take a look at it too as well
The maintenance person I had and then my cleaning team
I guess I've done a lot of previous rentals, but I've never done it this way, which I mean it was an awesome method
Oh, I was just saying on a scale of one to 10, are you at a 10? Are you excited for the call?
They actually have to do more with how the person thinks and the specific mental models that they operate with towards their Airbnb business
Okay, cool. And then out outside of that, how much capital do you have for deposits right now that you have available?
This point, so we didn't go any further. So what's on your mind?
And the reason we do this is just to protect against having blank space on our consultant's calendar
So is that kind of a service that Brian and BNB Formula offers?
There's so outside of my working experience, I'm a music engineer
And then also talk about any sort of further coaching or anything that we have to offer
As a part of his process, he just wants to make sure that he's helping anyone that needs to be helped in your business
For sure, man. Hope you have a rest of your hope the rest of your day is awesome, man.
But if I want my son to go there, that would be a big chunk coming out
How much are you bringing home each year in annual income?
And especially considering there are only a finite amount of slots available in the calendar and typically it's a $2,000 time slot
Yeah, Yeah man. I'm sorry for your loss
I have not had the time or the space and time
Would a 6:00 PM tomorrow work for you?
Oh then you're good to go. You're good to go. It's confirmed.
Prior to you watching the video. Totally get it. I won't.
Probably around 4:30 AM <laugh>. Okay,
And then we have a pre-call video that we send people in between booking and speaking to one of our consultants
And they'll talk to you about that and ask you some questions
A ball that <laugh> like let see me see my shirt score. It's in progress. It's in progress. Hold on. Okay. No, hold on. 6 25.
I just ran into a little glitch
So ever since then I was like, Yeah, that's the way you rent it out
Brian Page wanted me to reach out and give you a call to see how your Airbnb journey's going
Sure. Do you have anything more evening if it's not with Matt?
I'm just curious if you have any, have you gone into Airbnb yourself?
No, this is not, We actually, we're not on the sales team here. That is a different part of the company.
So we start time of your time if obviously
Well, taking more courses and investing more into myself I'd say. And then with that additional income I can begin in investing more as well.
But I just started building last year and I'm already starting on another project
And I honestly hate if you'd ever have to pay that
You can go ahead and save that
And then you mentioned that you're starting a new job soon
Yeah, well I say you're probably pretty far ahead than some other people
So I'm gonna, let's just say 200 to two 50 this year probably for the one business
I would love to make 30,000 a month <laugh>
Fumi, this is Thomas with b B Formula
Extra four to $5,000 a month. And why four to 5,000
Sometimes today you should call me back. He's probably on the middle line or something.
And is there any information specifically that you want for her to, that you wanna know from her? I can,
I'm gonna send that stuff over to you right now and look forward to hearing how your call goes
So for you, let's just call it a perfect world
No, no, go ahead. You're just want clarify.
I mean, yeah, that would be available to me, yeah. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> not credit.
Does any of that sound beneficial to you?
So I'm so happy about that
So do you mind helping me fill that in real quick? Just three questions here
So I just texted it over to you as well
<laugh>. Wow. That must not be a fun experience.
Operating range. All right, beautiful. Why
Free? And I think it's free. I hate hearing, I hate hearing that. I was thinking there is a catch <laugh>
Wait a minute, dude. How, Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Don't go. Hold on one second.
I actually work at a airport right now.
I'm like, well this is a ranch style, it's not a five star resort
I got you. If I don't do nothing else, I'll do that. I'll do that
Maybe it has nothing to do with Airbnb, I'd just be there for 'em to be a counselor
I don't know, but I'm, I'm in the process of selling two properties, so I will have some money here in March
Sounds like there's probably a lot of activity at the house
I mean I love what I do and as long as I take lots of breaks from what I do, then I'm good
If you're not able to show up to the call focus, you just randomly cancel no show something like that
Wanna make sure it's a hundred percent correct
I haven't really done too much of it because I'm still trying to figure out how to get all that going
And I honestly, I'd hate for you guys ever have to pay that
Could you just open it up and accept it really quick?
What would you do as an extra 20 to $30,000 a month coming in? Come
Gotcha. And then you've been working at the airport for about five years now?
So I'm gonna put you with Mr
Can you commit to watching that before your call on Wednesday?
But said there's no conflict so it shouldn't be an issue for you
However, exactly a good amount of cash flow or some kind of a cash flow would be nice
They're going all right. I think they could be doing a little bit better, I think.
I don't know, it's just like religion wise
Yeah, I know I purchased it but I was looking into Airbnb.
I'm getting my brother and his wife into it and this is something that is just, I think the opportunity is absolutely phenomenal here
But yeah, I guess I remember looking a little bit into it, but I didn't think I'd know how to apply it
And it sounds like you'd love to get to 20, $30,000 a month in residual income
Yeah, I don't know what happened but I'll be free at five.
But it's like at that point, what else should you invest in? And so that's where a lot of those opportunities come from
Sounds good. I like, All right. I appreciate it.
And then what is your gross annual income at the number you'd be putting on your tax return last year?
Oh, how many hours a week?
6 million this year on Airbnb and I mean he's figured a few things out
And now the Airbnb arbitrage, the average property is netting about $2,000 per month
Will you guys be able to watch that beforehand?
Hey you need to go do this
So you are confirmed with Miss Catherine Funk
Well Eric, I'm really glad we connected, man
You know what I mean? Kinda bootstrap
Cool. And then what are you bringing home in annual income from
I'll go ahead and email that to you right after this
And then it required the first, it required at least $4,000 down
I father passed away when I was a kid, so it was just my mom,
1 25. Gotcha. So it looks like
Do you have anything in the afternoon? Because I'm probably gonna be driving all morning
Do you remember ordering Brian Page's book on how to start an Airbnb business? About two and a half months ago
Yeah, sounds like you kinda like the guy everybody looks up to and you do all the extra stuff. <laugh>.
So we'll get that in there
Only reason I ask is it's super important for you
We've been trying to have children not being able to have children
Well, I mean after expenses, what do you spend your money on?
All right, thanks Jonathan. We'll talk to you soon. All right. Bye. Bye.
We got a lot of people who are successful in Chicago
Rogers has the context that he needs to help you figure out what kind of leases you can get approved for
Yeah, for sure. If I feel uncomfortable with them, I'll just let you know. Yeah, go ahead,
I will do that. I commit that to you. I will. You gonna send it to my email address, right? You already have it on file?
Yeah, I mean the, the majority probably surfing and snowboarding, doing those type of trips. That's the stuff I'm looking for the most.
Oh, thank you so much. I greatly appreciate it.
Tens of thousands of dollars? I mean, I feel like that's a little arbitrary. I'd rather say face to face with somebody.
Oh, there you go. <laugh>. Are you guys doing it in house this year? Have some Facebook
I really, I'd like to hear what you have available
So I just gotta make that decision, but I might have to get another property for Airbnb
So I need the book further
And Thursdays, Thursday's an all day show
My wife and I are having a very enjoyable conversation with one of our Airbnb guests
It's me, it's me right now
And past, if you got to $2,000 a month, I mean, are you good? I mean, you said that makes you happy
So that's all that she needs
I'm doing good. How are you?
Yeah, it looks like it came through on our side
Gotcha. And going back to what's like what's stopping you from getting to Airbnbs right now? What's holding you back?
And I would leave the country, I would leave somewhere else
So that's just why we do it
If you recall, you got his course a little while ago on how to make passive income with Airbnbs
Nope, it's the best right there.
Yeah, that's pretty crazy. I, I feel like I'm being listened. Listen to, does my phone hear me? What the hell,
Yeah, I mean that's awesome. I love the way you're thinking, thinking big. I
Since you, you're already a student, you're loving the course, the ball's rolling
Yeah, there's might to be made in Airbnb
But yeah, I mean with that being said, please be sure to do whatever you need to do, Remind yourself just cuz Mr
30, like a four o'clock Eastern. Four 30 Eastern?
Hey Torrance. It's Cooper with BV Formula from Brian Pages team. How you doing? Hey,
Oh, so like 4k a month?
Epiphany. No, we call these calls. Tcs. Yeah. Do you wanna know what TC stands for?
I don't have the date in front of me. Exactly.
We had put a couple bids on some homes in that area but it didn't go through, which is okay
I'm gonna send you over an email copy after this call
Okay. Okay. And so 20 outta 31 days in some of those later months and then around this time, January, February, doing significantly less than that?
I just compare what people are doing and I wasn't gonna make a move with him
What would you start doing with music when you like, what would it look like for you?
Okay. And then what is your gross annual income, the number you'd be putting on your tax return last year?
Honestly, I don't know if I'd want to put you with anyone else
None of that is I have any of that. No.
I was like, no, these guys are fucking geniuses, <laugh>
So I think it's everything that's all that Mr
But I mean, it'd be great to have the online copy as well
Working 60 hours a week and doing bartending school at the same time.
Oh yeah, for sure. I'm constantly on the phone with everybody.
If you show up to the call it's free. It's a hundred percent free of charge.
So with that said, is speaking with one of our expert Airbnb consultant something you think would be valuable for you?
<affirmative>. Okay. So at 400 k a year what would change for you?
Do you remember ordering Brian Page's book on how to start an Airbnb business? About two and a half months ago
I can't remember the guy's name that I went through there
Okay. And do you have about 45 minutes? That's typically how long the calls run in around 40 to 45 minutes.
And so what do you bring at home each year?
Okay, sounds good. And which time zone are you in?
I'm just thinking of if there's any way we could help you going with Airbnb
Right now? You mean? Or scheduled something?
That's what I like to go remodel, you know what I mean? It's auto
Yeah, well we can definitely find something that could work for you. It would only be about 40 to 60 minutes
So it would pretty much change things
I'm not trying to collect your credit card or anything like that
Okay. Yeah, for sure. That's a good business mindset to have. Keep reinvesting
I want to go back down there and see if it's all been rebuilt and they were there
Okay, understood. Well why do you think you would do that other than just that you replace the income?
So I have no idea because it all just depends because it just depends on a lot of different factors
He doesn't even sell that anymore
Understood. And how much available capital or cash on hand you have to put into deposits on properties, purchase furnishings for properties, that sort of thing?
Yeah, that was a pretty quick turnaround
But anyway So here's my question
So I'll go ahead and lock that in
And so he's really gonna be able to help you with that
Not right now cause it's summer so I'm trying to take advantage, just a little break and just rest up a little bit
So I think that's why I brought this up
It's purely commission based, so it varies
That's with both properties or 3000 a piece?
I'm gonna send over a calendar invite to your email herra 7 0 3 icloud
You have kids at home, but it's like the best of your ability because I only unlock the in at 10
I just texted it over link to
Probably not. Yeah. So if you got to 60 K a month passive I, what would you do with that extra income?
So that's I, and we can make that happen
I think you could get there sooner
Where do you think that sort of value comes from? It takes a special kind of person
Like I said, I'm a respiratory therapist
See and we'll say cuz usually holiday seasons are elevated in terms of pricing
Honestly, it might be easier if I just tell you about one of our guys that I was just talking to
So yeah, I might as well traveling now
Oh man, I think I'm, I'm gonna be the first millionaire
And I would say seven thou, I would say about, I'd say seven to $10,000 a month on both properties, May, June, July
Yeah, I'll definitely look over it.
So we're actually doing this big push right now to increase our average student results
Do you mind helping me fill that out really quick? It's just a few questions
They spent hours and hours mastering the frameworks that are most successful students actually use
That's actually what went over in the book
<affirmative>. No, no, I just listening to you said Matt Ren. Okay. Okay,
Jackson just so that he's got the context he needs to help figure out what might be best for you
I mean, I wanna make more what that said
Yeah. One o'clock would be better cause gives me a chance to make sure I'm fully up and everything else.
And how many trips over to be able to see family and stuff? Would you ideally like to be able to help 'em take
Yeah, I'm putting it on my calendar.
Well John, the reason I'm reaching out is I'm your student success manager for Brian
But that does sound like it's more of a starting point for you
And then the only other thing so I'm gonna put you with Mr
So I guess I wouldn't leave 200 passively, but 200 is about what I currently make
So I'm just trying to try something new, if that makes sense
I just want, don't want to have to work so hard for what I need
I'm familiar with rental, but when you say arbitrage, no, that's when I get confused with what is that. Yeah,
We'll say probably like seven hundreds just in that range
Currently I work at Milwaukee Tools three days a week.
Maybe be able to help out some folks that wanna do the same thing if you see success
Okay. Do you know what the available limits are on there?
I got the building blocks, I guess you could say
I have just a little bit. I've seen a couple things. I know they have some YouTube videos and stuff like that.
<affirmative>, Airbnb, I've got a basement, there's a buyer in it, this, that and the other
So I was going overseas out of the country about once a year <affirmative>
We had a found a heck of a deal in a pontoon soon
I just wanna be fully transparent with you and make sure you could make it
12. Is that 12 hours a day? So you're working like 70? Yeah, 12
I mean having the freedom to do whatever financial, do whatever financially
And then I just sent over a counter invite so you can go ahead and accept that after the call if you want
No I didn't. But I'm just curious where it works. Area code.
We'll put that down in the notes here
And so you're doing the market agency now that sounds like you're really having to hustle and move to get clients for that.
Time. Yeah, no problem. So, So this is set up for possible mentor or coaching in the area, correct?
You know what I mean? But that's kind of what I'm going for
This is Thomas with B Formula
50 to a hundred thousand, I don't know.
So had nothing to do with the work
It's like 12 minutes long to watch it before your call
Timing was not right and then my finances were not very good at that time as well and I was trying
The initial. Okay. And then after you have a hundred K, what's, what's the long term goal for this?
Yeah. Do you think your wife would think if you guys were going on a bunch of more vacations?
And I mean that's one of the first things you said
Oh great. Time zone. I'm as well in Arizona.
All right. Lemme pull for calendars here.
And I mean, passive income at the moment is not very much
All right, sir? Yeah, I'm Eastern Standard. Yep, I'm here. I'm in Virginia.
And just to double confirm, before I lock in you can a hundred percent make the one 30 later today?
Are we talking about a sales call or an information call?
So that's where I would like to change that so she wouldn't need to worry about that
<laugh>. And so that's what he's doing.
And so Deborah, you are locked in and good to go for Mr
Do you remember purchasing the BNB Formula book from Brian Page teaches you how to become financially independent with Airbnb?
Just not to have to stress about your next paycheck <affirmative>
Yeah, no doubt. And then shoot me that book and I'll familiarize myself with it on this slide.
So for you, in a perfect world, let's just say you didn't have any boundaries
But I'm pretty much just pretty much still doing the same thing I've been doing
So I'm allowed to hook you up with some free resources to make that happen
Okay. Is this the number I would text you at?
And the vision first of 10 k months, you can leave a job is set Example for daughter, for your daughter
Yeah. I love animals, so I wanna go on a safari.
And also a apology as well for how things were handled in the beginning
Gotcha. You okay between the two? Yeah.
Eventually, at least, I would say 10,000 a month just starting off.
I did, I did get the book.
Don't charge my credit card, whatever credit card you have on file prior to me just don't do that
So realistically, based on that schedule, does that all make sense?
How is that possible? You've gotta want something for it.
I'm doing fantastic my man. Do you remember purchasing Brian's book on how to start an Airbnb business?
I thought you were just gonna take my money and run so at least I'll get a phone call out of it
Clear after everything is taken care of after, so what I guess I would say so let's change it now I'm
Yeah, that's super nice. That's flexible. Maybe you could actually sort just transition naturally.
That's all the context that our Mr
Just completely disrespectful to the consultant, just ghosting 'em or something like that
There's only a finite amount of spots on the calendar typically and it is a thousand dollars slot
The fact you're doing so much right now, bartending school plus, plus, that's your wholesale and looking at the solar job
Well, I just did my taxes and after all the expenses and whatnot, however it Oh gross
Yeah, about probably I are invested in some real estate of course cause that's my key thing
Oh, so you already have a property?
We definitely recommend your first Airbnb to at least be somewhere within about an hour's drive of you
All right. Thanks for reaching out. Yeah. Yes. Yeah,
A lot of people like to put a E in it, but not an E, just t a l l y
Technically there is a money limit of technically you can get out if you make too much money in the military
Yeah. I have a quick question for you. How much in is needed? How much does it take to invest in? How much does it cost?
Brown has everything he needs so I'm super excited to see how our conversation goes
West Coast out there? Yeah, we're mount time out here.
Tempes just has anyone I put on his calendar like this, watch that pre-call video beforehand
Did you text it to me? Yes. There we go. Let's see.
So if you were able to make just crazy amounts of money with Airbnb, you talking millions, tens of millions of dollars,
Well at the moment that sounds better.
And because this is a serious opportunity, and I can hear in your voice that this is something you wanna do
And also I'll get you in a group chat with Mr
Pay off some bills. Cause I rented a house in Virginia. Yeah.
I wasn't sure, maybe a couple thousand a month.
So I just wanna basically triple check to make sure that that time works for you
Is your best email address Dana Miller gmail? The best phone number for the executive? Are you on one right now? Okay
No, that's just what we're getting paid at. That's not including expenses or anything. So that is our growth not net. Right.
And the reason why we have that policy in place is just obviously we want to protect our executive consultants time
I just ask when you write your book that you include me in the introduction, <laugh>, definitely
So between my salary and the business income and everything, it was like over 400
I was recently approved for a mortgage but this market's too crazy for me not getting into this emotionally driven market
20 K a month or more? Yep, exactly dude
Now Daniel when leasing properties, it should be listing on Airbnb
I think she lived in London or somewhere, I can't remember her name
I'll definitely have Diane send that over to you
So it sounds, I mean, that's awesome man
I would definitely Seriously, seriously, I will. Definitely.
So trying to find ways to make passive money and hopefully eventually stop doing all 2000 for 60 hours a week
What dude, I went down the same path, honestly. I started trading four x right when I graduated college. <laugh>.
My wife, I can tell her what's going on
Okay. I have a four, have a three o'clock or a four o'clock in the afternoon, would sometime around there be better.
Correct, correct. That's exactly how I feel.
Cool. So first question, ballpark range, do you know what your credit score's at?
Texas and Dallas. There you go. Arlington by Dallas.
I actually have not gotten the book yet.
I'm not sure if he understands the building of that property to many levels
So sorry, I'm not familiar with exactly the deal or the agreement that was written out
And an ideal world? I would love to not have to work and this could be my full-time job. That would be my ideal. That's
Okay, let me tell you what spots I have
Is that the best email for you and for a calendar invite?
Trying to get my fucking, trying to get my money right.
Cause I'm willing to make, if it takes longer, then I would like it
Yeah, well, no, I'm just cool to hear you guys are doing it in your own house
Mean right now I have a property, I need to generate some cash in the property
Well, if I can find some time in our calendar, we can do it within the next 48 hours
Okay, gotcha. Set up a little Airbnb while you get onto your next place. <affirmative>. Are you guys moving?
<laugh>. Yeah. So 10 K is more of a stepping stone for you. It doesn't sound like you would stop there, right?
Not? Nah, there's no finish line honestly
Well people don't really follow people's businesses, they follow brands nowadays and brands are who you are as a person
Thanks. I got it. I got it. All right. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
And we get a call, Yeah, pick it up
So let's get some context on where you are right now
I mean, that's basically where I'm at
Just changes your level of conviction too
So let me ask you this question
Do you mind helping me fill that out real quick? Just a few questions
But right now it'll be me and Jake, but now
And then first of all it's, it's kind of an extra investment besides what I'm doing right now
And I'd like to be able to pass down to have them give our kids opportunity, Hey, here's what you got
Well I appreciate you taking the time and you're good to go for Mr
So it's like I don't have the time really to waste on something that may or may not work
Awesome. So is your number the 4 86 3 7 0 4.
I can send that over to you as well
It's gonna be profitable for you down the line
Yeah, these were properties. This was properties that I did own, yes.
If you want me to go upstairs and quickly ask Ellen if she's free, then I can take a minute and come like that
Is there any other properties that you're working with now?
Okay. Yeah, please do that. Cause in this four it happens. Okay.
We get to enjoy more of the things that really matter for us and our time is the most valuable asset
According to Credit Karma, we're about seven 70.
I wish I just read the book, but I'm just a super busy person unfortunately
I'll go ahead and fire that off for you and we should be good to go
We have an 11 and 12 open on Wednesday
At the end of the day, the money's really just a tool to get what you want
So what's your credit score at right now?
You don't have to stop buying properties or finding them <affirmative>
Yep. 12 31 30 central time.
Right? I would 10,000 starting off. I guess I can give it more of a broader range.
And he's like, Yeah, but this guy's sitting here with a briefcase with a half a million dollars over asking price
She just partners with the owners,
Right? Some of the and correct
What would I have accomplished in a year?
Yeah. How much do you need to be bringing in each year
That would kind of allow you to retire and ultimately have some more free time
And so they just want you to come in
I have to get my parents out their situation first and they're not in a bad situation
Yeah, I think it would be great.
And how long have you been doing the HVAC?
So <laugh> too bad I didn't start this earlier, but anyways, I mean I'm, there's no point where I'm saying, okay, let's stop
So all of the coaches have personally done six or even seven figures with their personal Airbnb businesses
It's good talking to you and we'll have you talk to Ben later on this evening
And if they said you probably a good fit for a program, then they'd really handle all these details
What approved what you been approved for?
Hey, do you remember spending about a thousand dollars with us on the B and b formula course a while back?
So the last thing I want end up getting in debt due to medical reasons
Oh, that's dope. That's dope. Yeah, yeah. I'm like 20 minutes from Gilbert.
I mean, what would change for you personally? What would you do with some of that extra income?
The guy ended up no showing and it was a huge issue
Who's called? Hey, Ryan. It's, It's Cooper with b B Formula from Brian Pages team. How you doing?
First question is just do you know what your credit score is last time you checked?
I've never been up to the Montana and the Northwest
Brian wants me to just check in and see if there's any way we can help folks
This is a special case cuz I wanna hook you up
And just so you know, the way this works, it's super simple
Awesome. Well I'll let Mr. Brown know that you'll be watching it and Cody, I'm curious to see how it goes for you, man.
She may or may not join
Got a couple SY systems in place working well for him
Yeah, most definitely. And why that specifically? Why is that important to you?
So I'll text both of those
I mean, anything that has tripped you up in the past, you get prepared with that sort of thing
Yeah, but you're saying this consultation is free, correct?
Okay. All right. Sounds good. Awesome. So just to double confirm, four clock central time tomorrow? That works?
Oh, awesome. Where in Europe are you guys gonna go?
And it's actually one of the reasons I'm reaching out
We would absolutely 100% need you to watch that all the way through beforehand
Cool. Is jake bower 10 gmail.com the best email for you?
So I get a lot of referrals from people
I mean, I was still pretty young and I'm graduating college at the end of this year
Totally. That's awesome, man. So what got you interested in Airbnbs in the first place?
Glen, what was Greg? Good to know you
Well, it's a longer term goal for you that you could hope to get to after a while, 12 months down the road
I'm in California. Yeah, Los Angeles.
Where do you feel like the drive to wanna do that comes from?
Just looking to invest, honestly, at that time as well
I know credit's a little bit different up in Canada, but do you happen to know what your credit score is?
I'm m actually out in, I'm actually out in town right now.
I say everybody's financial situation is different
Yes. Yeah, I could do that. I could arrange it a different area.
That's all the context that Mr
I just wanted to make sure that's clear
I'm doing wonderful. Kristen, you ever spending about a thousand dollars with us on the b and b formula course while back?
You hear me? Yeah, can you hear me?
We've been super hosts since we began actually
Just wanted to triple check, man
It's so funny, the spouse always has more questions than the other person
I work here with Brian Page on the student success team for him
Well, thank you. Thank you very much.
Do we have anybody who's working that late?
Cause this year I think it would be different because last year was Covid, so this really different and I think Covid push us
Could you just go ahead and accept it really quick?
Okay, gotcha. Have you considered doing Airbnbs in neighboring cities or potentially somewhere in Sacramento?
Yeah, everything smooth and that stress free, so
So I'll send you a text a little bit before your call just so you kind of have confirmation as well
I can't explain it. Yeah, I can't explain that.
Does that ring a bell? That
We do have a few times available in the evening. What time could you and her husband both down the call?
Too. Awesome. And we were just talking, have you heard the conversation up to this point so far?
I wanna put Airbnb in this property
But in the winter for five, six months out of the year at least, it's just sitting there, it's completely renovated, updated
That'll be appropriate. I'm so sorry. I'm really wondering where this is at right now. <laugh>,
Yeah. Do you want me to share it?
Now obviously I love that thinking big is unlimited is a great goal
You rent it out all month long like a hotel, and then you pay back the landlord what he is asking for rent
And just to clarify, what time heading out to the airport tomorrow?
Typically it does a thousand dollars time slot
Well, the only reason I ask is just to have everyone informed on the same plane if he's also a decision maker
Oh, okay. Sorry, you cut out there for a second. Oh
So it sounds like you would reinvest the earnings a bit
No. No, no, no, no. I got bigger plans beyond that.
I think I may have a super solid idea of how it could help you
Direction. Okay. Yeah, you're trending up. We love to see that <laugh>
And Airbnb's in a great spot now
Cooper, okay. Nice to meet you
But I have not made any goals with Airbnb yet
Why? That was just a rough off the dome.
Cool, brother. I will lock it in and send it over to you.
Yeah man the vision really is long term and that's really what I want to do
Just have the same last name
I don't know what I'm doing tomorrow, but yeah, 1:00 PM sounds like it would work
So all those guys have personally done six, even seven figures with their personal Airbnb businesses
That'd be superb if you could get it to a six month income or rather a six figure income in under a year
Yeah, that would work. Like a two o'clock, 3 30, 3 30 probably would be better.
Is that come with a fee or how does that call work?
All right. Thank you so much.
Are there any openings over the weekend?
And even if I haven't even started the, cause I feel like, I mean I haven't started anything with it
Oh, you want that as your backup? So I'll send the information in the calendar invite over to the Hotmail address?
Time for? Places that, Yeah, I would go to places that we might not think of
I mean that's something that I do now is invest in just random stocks and stuff like that or Roth accounts and whatnot
It just seemed like there was just too much risk there
<affirmative>, but Well, you can arrange time, but we can discuss later about you're talking about the higher, more of a personal coach program or whatever.
Appreciate it. I'll let you go then. Yeah, of course. Have a great rest of your evening. Okay. All right, bye-bye
A 10, I'll show up and take notes and I won't have no distractions. That's not a problem at all.
So if you're not able to show up to the call focus, you just randomly cancel or no-show and something like that
They're busy. I understand that. I'd
Oh yeah, I ant see, I don't know the numbers and I'm up here doing some other things right now as well
I'll go ahead and I sent over a calendar invite to you as well but everything's good to go
We do a couple a year and then it's a few bunch of mini vacations
These guys are literally the best in the business, plus the end of the call
Yeah, of course. That's what I'm here to do.
Yeah, I have a list between me and my girlfriend
So just so that they're fully aware, is there anyone else involved or who would be involved? Maybe a spouse or a partner?
So still, I mean I'm still very interested in it
And just so that we're fully there, you don't have any business partners or anything, right? You would just be doing this yourself, correct?
Okay. Do you know what your credit score is at?
So I gotta be in front of my laptop is on the phone
You're like, I wanna see some real results from some real people besides you first make sure you have results
Oh, I see. Wow. Eight properties. Okay.
Carol, this is Thomas with b B Formula Brian Page's team
They've spent thousands of hours studying psychology, mental models, mental frameworks that are able to help people get to the next level
Is it completely impossible for you to sit aside and make one of those times tomorrow
I talked to some people and they say, I'm living off of nine K a year and I have $0 available
A lot of people have kind of been in the same boat
Okay, how may I help you sir?
We'll get you in at about 3:00 PM Eastern tomorrow
It's time to commit to a change, right? It sounds like you're ready
Basically I gotta get contact, I gotta get clients
Will we be able to watch that before you speak to him tomorrow?
Oh, I definitely quit my regular job, yes.
Correct? Yep. Yep, right now. Cool brother. Yeah, I'm in Phoenix as well, so we're on the same time.
How much more would you wanna make
So you're officially confirmed and reserved for Mr
I'm sorry, I just looked up my credit score
And sometimes you don't even pay for furniture
And so what sparked your interest in the first place?
So I mean I definitely appreciate the strategy that he employed and I think it was genius
Pull up the <inaudible> here really quick
Him. Okay. Yep, Yep. Let's do a five o'clock Eastern on Friday. That work?
People are like, Yeah, my mom is like, yo, don't do your program, do mine
I'm working on things as of right now
Goer has the context that he needs in order to help figure out what kind of lease you need approved for
Now if you're self-employed, they're gonna look at two years of a 10 99 tax form
Yep, I see it. Add it to my Apple calendar.
I, I'll feel as honestly as though I'm paying a lot more attention to it in the past
And that could potentially I can see where you would think that now it's interesting <inaudible> inverse relationship
I kind of got a good feel on that
Yeah dude I feel like 800,000, a million
I would say with hair or just with anything
So that really motivated me and I'm just doing what I can right now
So just forward that over to you
And I know that sounds like I'm playing small and I've whatever, but I just need some help getting out of the mud
And what would you do with some of the extra time? Obviously you got kids
And so you saw that, you're like, okay, I see this guy, this actually might be legit with what he is doing
Well, awesome. Hey, do you remember spending about a thousand dollars with us on the BNB Formula course of allow back?
So just life happens, emergencies happens
But it's not gonna gimme anything
She's literally one of the best in the world, especially how people get started and figuring out the right process for getting Airbnbs
And it sounds like you have it in your calendar as well
They regularly charge like a thousand dollars just for a single 60 minute consulting session
<laugh> they tell you after they booked that of course.
So for you, in a perfect world, no boundary, what was the ideal income you're hoping to get to?
So that's all the information that Katherine needs and she's been able to give you the best guidance with that information
That number 25, actually 25 to 50,000, I mean 25 would be, I could feel that
Eastern time zone. Okay. So we have Monday, we have 11:00 AM and we have 2:00 PM available
And then you stage it up all nice with furniture and you can actually throw it on Airbnb
Well congratulations to normal something that probably how people I talked to, they talked about that
Absolutely. You ever made it that much, that quick
Brian Page, the guy who wrote the book on the Airbnbs that you got
Jackson's like process, he just wants to make sure he is helping everyone out that needs to be helped
I'll make sure I checked off all my boxes for our consultant here, Mr
So that's really like that maximizing cash flow <affirmative>, he's doing the rental arbitrage model and started in February, didn't have anything yet
Be wave the fee for you back here
Yeah, between what times phone call, what times are you looking at?
Just cash on hand right now, probably around 8,000.
You said what? I'm sorry, I'm at the mail shop so I can kind of hear you, but I can't What was that again?
So obviously the first thing to look at when you're going to get a lease is your credit score
Oh, I don't, Yeah, I don't know
Okay. Do you wanna pull up your calendar for tomorrow and let me know what you're seeing
I mean, it would be something like setting myself up for even more success I guess you could say
And not yet, having an Airbnb is totally normal
Sure. I've got two minutes before I get home and then I have to
Cause I already have the book I need the core
I drive from five to five or five to four in the afternoon or five to six in the afternoon
If you don't mind telling me, what is your credit score?
Did you have a full conversation with one of the people from our student success team?
And that's actually part of the reason I'm reaching out because we've helped hundreds of people create six figure incomes on Airbnb
Okay. So do you wanna defer the call on Monday or are we still doing the call on Monday?
So I'm curious for you cuz you know, invested in the course, you guys have properties going long term, perfect world
Okay, so we're gonna have you sit down with Mr
Does 11:00 AM or 1:00 PM work better for you?
All right, good. So dude, okay good. So are you gonna send me over an email or are you gonna take this over the phone or?
That would be possible. It would probably take about four or five years.
And honestly John, I think you're right to be that It wasn't communicated
And you just press save in the top right corner.
This isn't just make some money so we can buy some cool things
Okay. Right. Sounds good. Great, thanks.
So <affirmative>, I know that's one of the biggest concepts of doing this Airbnb business is how passive that it can become
Cool man. So are you in central time or eastern time?
Cause they actually work directly with Brian Page and they regularly charge about a thousand dollars for a single hour consulting
All right. Thank you very much.
I wanna make it work because I do do know that I've seen quite a bit of stuff about it and I know it'll work.
My property is located in Blythe, California, which is not too far away from you guys in Arizona
I mean, if things got going good and my wife didn't have to work anymore, then she'd be involved
So they work directly with Brian Page himself and they regularly charge about a thousand dollars just for a single
I can't remember at the top of my head.
They want to do Airbnb, they'd already be doing it
That's not how the hell they do. They stay busy. Cause I, There's nothing here <laugh>.
It's the one that teaches you how to certain Airbnb business without actually owning any of your own property
Financial freedom? Well, kind of just exactly what the word is
What if would love an opportunity to see if there's any possibility of expanding with and being successful at this
There you go. Okay. So on a scale from one to 10, how excited would you say you are
What's kind of like the ideal monthly income you'd be hoping to get to with this
Yeah, I mean why not? Right? But that's the first sort of benchmark for you
It does well. I work a full time job on top of it. So busy, not, definitely not sustainable for long term
You know, called me at a good time, at a time that I don't mind talking most of the time
Okay. Yeah. And where do you guys feel like the drive to wanna retire early comes from
So how much are you bring in home each year?
And give you some action steps to what you might need to do
Ready to take some notes. I'll have my notes out and things like that, so.
I just want multiple income sources
So I'm curious cuz usually people don't invest about a thousand dollars into a course once there's a specific result they're looking to get to
I can give this opportunity to someone else, especially considering there's only a few spots on the calendar
And I guess I took care of my dad <affirmative>, so of course I'm gonna take care of my mom
There's a ton of different ton of write offs
Matt, you, I see a serious opportunity in actually helping you out
Well I feel like I have a little bit more clarity
And probably right when my, yeah, so I, again, whatever, just like everybody
So you have one property? Is that what you said?
So six 20 is actually, yeah, it's actually pretty solid
Could you help me fill it out really quick? Just a few questions?
It's not like the monthly cash flow into your pocket every single month
We have really quick, You're in Pacific time zone. I
Would you wanna sit down with someone at
So the cash flow that we see folks getting from it is significantly higher
I'd rather do my own thing anyway
Hey. It's Thomas with b B Formula Brian Pages team. How you doing?
I do see some serious opportunity in helping you
So we're in the business of helping people, the executive consultants, they honestly like helping people a lot more than I do
And of course there's ways to get creative with that if the numbers aren't the best, which it's totally okay if they aren't
And if you could just figure out how to get other properties be well on your way to hitting that six figures a year
And what we've found is that a lot of people are doing this on top of another job or with another business
<laugh>. Yeah, for sure. Gotta what you're driving around in
So anytime from Monday through Tuesday I should be available
I don't know that it would do it or not
I just don't have a plan on how to start it
But of course that costs money and there's that
Then that's the only reason do
It talked about creating passive income with Airbnbs that actually owning the property. It looks like you may have gotten that book a few weeks ago
That's just based on me in my current state
<laugh>? I'm from here. My, actually it's my grandmother's do and it's, Wow, two names. My parents got creative. They wanted their moms.
If you got the place with Airbnb, were you able to? Yeah, did it cut out for a second?
I mean, they're light years ahead of me
Other than that all the finer details we can work out on Monday
It would enable me another $10,000 a month would enable me to go travel around the country
Yeah, I mean I'm working a solid amount right now
So one last thing I'm required to do here, just fill out a little form so that our executive consultant, Mr
We'll get you locked in and rocking and rolling
I'd rather much put it towards something that's gonna probably produce more cash flow and just make us more secure
Well my mom's still up there when it comes to getting an apartment like there, right there on Broadway, downtown Nashville
What time zone are you in?
I've been in pain for 15 years, had the xyz, you can do it, don't sit there and tell me you don't have time
They say you don't have to be, but when it all boils down, they're telling you the same thing
Nope, I you'll have a hundred percent of my attention at 12 on Monday.
Can you do me a favor and just pull up your calendar for tomorrow and just see what you got going on
Beautiful. Okay. Which time zone are you in?
I still have a lot of career left to fulfill, so
Due time, no. Right now, yes.
I mean it'd probably be maybe a week or two type of thing.
Yeah, well I'm all about it. That's why I spent the money, but it just I don't know. I'd love to know how they did it.
They're literally the best in the business
Do you mind, help me fill that out real quick? It's just three quick questions
Meaning. What do you mean by that
Damn. Nice bro. I'm from Seattle.
That is one of the hardest parts we found
So I actually I'm a long time residential real estate investor with just a straightforward buy and hold on long-term rentals
That makes sense. Yeah. I mean,
<laugh>, have you been at it for a while?
Is that why you're interested in that?
And I was look at my calculation
I mean that's one of the things that we focus on at bmd
I'll send you a calendar invite with his name on it as well
Okay. All right. All right, Cooper.
So fun, fundamentally, if our customers are doing amazing then the company will grow and grow faster
I do see a serious opportunity in helping you get into this
So I want to get back being what I used to be, so
So I really don't know what I need really
Perfect. All right, man. Sounds good. I appreciate it.
Okay. And which time zone are you in
But I mean, dude, I just wanna help as many people as I can
Plenty. When I'm out here all the time when you're on the boat, you're here 24 7.
So at this moment, I don't have to be honest, I don't have any capital
That actually doesn't come out of mine
It should be picking up though
Let me go ahead and check that really quick. So let's see, Looks like we do have some time slots of it on Friday.
I, I'm with BNB formula on Brian Page's team
I just don't want that on record <affirmative>.
Plenty of ways to get creative with all that and delegate and automate
And there's only 4 million hosts
So I represent a vertical integrated grower
It's one of our goals to help people who are just beginning, jumpstart their biz, get some serious results right off the bat
I work for myself so I can make my own schedule, but I'd have to change my lifestyle a little bit
Yeah, it's where the timer symbol is. That's where all of it is. Okay, so then log timer, top part alarm, world clock.
Right? Well since just about a month ago we moved it to Harriman, Tennessee.
Sorry about that. My time. My life is just so much in the play right now. I would love to.
I show B and b I trading the markets
And we rented out this Airbnb on and it was nice
Yeah, there's a couple executive consultants I have on my team that I'm rather close with
How many people do you ideally want be helping out and impacting? Is that tens? 20, 30?
And that's, looking back at childhood memories is the most precious times ever
So it looks like the time at 1:00 PM is available with Mr
Cooper. Okay. Yeah, Cooper. Sure. Yeah, go ahead.
All right, man, I gotta run head to my next job. I'll see you, man.
Two properties. And you own the home, is
Okay, gotcha. Well, that seems like a bit of a change now. What are you doing roughly in monthly income from your real estate portfolio now?
And that's why I kept really thinking hard about Airbnb lately to get to passive income goal
Stratton needs to figure out what's gonna be best for you
I just came from doing sales ADT and I killed it
I can be Tuesday after five
And Lorenzo, is there any reason why you wouldn't be able to make the call later today? Just cuz Mr
And so you were confirmed in with him
You're good on money, you've gotten your retirement set up, you're good for the next 30 years
Yeah. So were you asking me or
Cause to the financial, Not financial, sorry
I don't know if I did get the book. Was it an ebook? Say again?
Afternoon, you wanna do do tomorrow? Tomorrow? Does early afternoon work like 1231?
I've had some hardships growing up that I should never felt days where we wouldn't have food
I gotta take a look at the calendar first, see what I could do here. But does that sound cool?
Gotcha. Just jotting us a couple things down here.
So you guys are basically assisting
And I'm your biggest cheerleader here, man
The honest truth, I've never heard of Airbnb
If you could do that for free For me, I a hundred percent love to talk to somebody
Here's what I can do here
No, that's not too much in the cars
They qualifying calls and qualifying appointments and closing before you even start your beer
Yeah, sure. I only have one appointment today so that should be fine.
I get investors to do that
Okay. Central time. We pull up the calendar here and see what we can do. What does Monday look like for you?
So I'll make sure to let Mr
Yeah, I was doing the wholesaler, man
So yeah, once I have more information, I'll talk to your exact, we can kind of figure out a plan
Breakfast, lunch and dinner is so good
Rogers, just make sure that anyone I place on his calendar watches a super important pre-call video beforehand, just takes about 20 minutes
So Java is my nickname and
That's like, that's a whole nother animal
And your name came across my desk this morning, so here I am giving you a ring
I mean, I'm literally at home
And so how much available capital do you have, whether it's in savings, crypto stocks, basically liquid capital to put into deposits on leases
Yeah. 4 0 0 6 6 1 4 7 0 9 7 5 0 1 9.
Well I know usually people don't look into a business opportunity like this unless they're with a specific result they're hoping to get to
He qualified for the Olympics about 10 or 15 years ago
Real estate and Airbnb is some good stepping stones towards that.
<laugh>? Well I think she'd be all for it once she wants to retire in the next five years
I would say I have at least 10 to 15 grand for that.
You pay rent of 1200 and all of a sudden you're making $1,400 net
No problem. Cool man. We'll talk to you soon. Okay. You can text me if you need anything,
And the reason why we have that policy in place is just obviously we want to protect our executive consultants' time
That's why I said most people, I mean just it pretty much like the bank, your money make money with it
So what, help me understand when you say that he's on your executive consulting team tell me how that typically works
All right, you too. Likewise. Bye. Bye.
Started right now. Why would we get the gas <affirmative>?
So that's why I looked into the program
Sorry about the beeping. It's really, if you can hear that it's really snowy here. So there's snow on all my sensors in the car.
Think where my dumb wallet is
Rogers, make sure anyone I put on his calendar watches an important pre-call video beforehand, so it really just takes a few minutes
Cool. So how do you feel you would want to give back if you had enough to give back?
Rogers does make sure that everyone I place on his calendar watches a very important pre-call video beforehand, so just takes about 20 minutes
Yeah, so my full-time job salary was around one 15. And then real estate this year I'm expecting around 80, 90.
All right, and what time zone? Like Eastern Mountain Pacific, Eastern
No, it would just be for me
Would you be opposed to that?
If it's not a good fit for you, then they wouldn't bring it up
You just didn't pull that trigger, man
But I guess we'll call it nine to five for now
You imagine that man taking your motor home out the Grand Canyon and just looking over that thing, taking that in. Oh yeah,
And I respect the vision you have for really giving back to your community and feeding back into it is amazing, man
But I'll make that decision when I get there on Wednesday
I do what I do because it allows me to do the things I love to do
And so at a very high level, that's the model he teaches
Cause you can't just pick up and go.
Well first it would allow them to know that someone cares for them that much and which is helpful emotionally and mindset wise moving forward
My friend's staying in Arizona right now. It is five 15. So you guys a hour behind
So I'm just that type of person
I be perfectly fine with me. I mean, can't, certainly can't hurt anything and free of charge. Perfect.
And honestly, I would hate to get a call from Brian that showed, cause I seriously love what I do
So central time tomorrow, so I have a four 30 and a 6:00 PM tomorrow
You remember getting the book a while back starting an Airbnb business, right
Is that something you'd wanna take advantage of?
So six figures a year comes out to a little over $8,000 a month
Yeah. That's awesome. How would they react if you retired?
Okay, we're gonna switch it up to Christopher. Let know you're ready.
Yeah, it's different for each person
Just being able to have more avenues of incomes
I have an appointment tomorrow evening, but if there's nothing on Wednesday then we can I guess shoot for tomorrow. But
Yeah. Can you send the video? Yeah,
I'm sorry I didn't even that
It'll most likely be us together, but I will be the main driving force.
Well I'll just put a couple things down here and then the only other thing is that Mrs
So you're on Eastern time for now
Is it the Bull River that's right up there?
Okay. Now I gotta take a look at the calendar first, but how does that sound?
Between everything you're doing, the amount of time you're putting in, what specifically that you're looking to automate with the cleaning service
I don't know the numbers off top
I was working on doing it and it is on my to-do list for sure
But I haven't really done any research or courses
I just a few questions just to get some context from where you're at.
And I have a super solid idea of how I can help you out
Sorry, I thought you were a spam number. My man.
But you're gonna be paying somebody to do that though,
Moved, so it's been kind of hectic.
You can shoot me a text, I'll text you after this
Do you guys do evening appointments?
How much do you have in that?
Yeah, it would just be a 60 phone call
Right, exactly. And were you able to get any traction on Airbnb? Did you ever take any steps to get started or anything like that?
And I'd love to hear if you just shoot me a text after the call, let me know how it goes
Wow. <affirmative>. And what do you think that would do for them?
So I should be, yeah, I should be up cause I get up like seven cause I mm-hmm <affirmative> that's being lit
Whenever, if you stop by, I have a told you the house
But yeah, this is like, dude, it's legit
Cause typically it is a thousand dollars time slot
Really quick, could you just pull up your Gmail inbox and just accept the calendar invite I just sent over?
And so I'll pull up the calendar here
And what we found is that those folks were working about two to three hours a week
Yeah, you too brother. We'll talk to you soon. Okay,
So it looks like you're in central standard time right now
Let's just say a year from now, you're making a ton of money with Airbnb you're just absolutely crushing it
I'm in the Eastern time zone.
Yeah, I know you got a lot going on.
With that being said, Gavin, what got you interested in Airbnbs in the first place?
Yeah, so they'll give you a call.
Yeah, let me pull that up here.
But if you got the software or anything else, as long as you have the email address, then you should be good
What's your credit score right now?
So that's really what I do here
And I'll send you a calendar invite so you have that
He's actually our top executive consultant
<affirmative>, how much I money do you think you would need to be able to do that?
Do you want me to call you back later today or tomorrow when you know your business partners scheduled?
Cause I know if I keep walking I'm gonna lose you and it's gonna seem like I hung up on you
Man. We just give me a call tomorrow or something. Got a phone,
To replace my full-time income, I would need 3,500 a month.
And my perception was, okay, it's very possible to get to the same thing with an Airbnb model
Okay. And do you have a hundred dollars?
Oh, I've been doing that for 20 years.
All right. Go ahead. What's your,
You. I'm doing alright man. I appreciate you calling back.
I'm gonna send you over a calendar invite to la ddrick d gmail
Well they're lot years ahead of me
So if maybe wasn't on the table, what would you do to get outta your job?
I don't wanna work the way that I, Healthcare requires medical providers to work and so it's just time
And that's with, that's without any variables
And you know what I'd love to hear
But there's probably some other instances, <affirmative>, I can't off the top of my head, but that would be
All right. Does that make sense? All
Unless a miracle happens and <laugh>, then that would be different
You do have enough coming in to replace your full-time income and the way Brian teaches that is getting the leases on the properties
What would the schedule be like? When would that be possible though?
All right. So no problems there, but
And then are you familiar with the rental arbitrage model that was talked about in the book?
Okay. Yeah, let me know what it is.
Yeah, so I mean basically they can kind of hop on with you, dive deeper into exactly where you're at with everything
So the first question is just credit score
I just wanna see if it's good for me
Okay, thanks you, Thomas. All right. You're welcome. All right, have a good day. You're
Yes, I think it would be.
When you originally bought the course, what were you hoping to accomplish with the Airbnb?
I'm getting old so I just need to enjoy what I have, see the country I've been ignoring for all of my life
That's good to hear man. John, do you ever spending a thousand dollars on Brian's b b formula course while back?
Vegas is a great commercial real estate area right now and my buddy, I'm kind of blessed to be around him
At. And I mean, why do you wanna be an entrepreneur?
Oh, okay. So in total, so you have 65 from the job. In terms of total income per year, what are you bringing home?
If that does we, that we have on
So it it's really not dependent on outside circumstances, but what he wants for you in your life
And I, I'd honestly hate for you guys to ever have to pay that
Probably the morning one would be better,
So he is stationed in Virginia, Virginia Beach area.
And this will get you on that running start
Based on last year asking this question again, when we finish out this year, I, I'll tell you, I guarantee it'd be different.
Yeah, I think that's a very good story
The only last thing here is that Mr
So as a part of, Seems Matt, Matt Rensy as a part of Mr
And you know, mentioned your wife as well
I love that you're thinking that way and it's obviously something that seems like it's really important to you
Yeah. Well no, I mean that's the only way I'm gonna do it, unless it's gonna be <inaudible>, but
I could pull some strings here
Either one would work. Okay. I prefer 11:00 AM but either one works.
But shouldn't be an issue for you, you're just watching kids tomorrow
What was your motivation for getting into Airbnbs?
Okay, so when people ask me what I do, I say electrician cuz it's more of a general statement
It's something you can do and potentially help other people do
Yeah, you can just rent from them too
It is, honestly it is achievable
Yeah, I gotta put in my credentials for my email to Okay. I think add it on here.
You could sit down with a pen and paper ready to take some notes
And so is Airbnb kind of a way to basically be able to make enough income? You could focus on that full time
But you'll have to send me your contact information
Going home telling your husband, Hey we're going across seas next week and you guys just pick up and go,
So you can put those two together to get a ballpark
It's about two hours west of Nashville where Nashville is, I'm sure.
And then he has a bunch of different things in between
Okay. I mean I don't have very much in assets. I maybe have around 10 grand, 10 maybe 13. Yeah.
I can't really base things off of what I think
Yeah, let's make sure you guys are both on that questions answer and be good for you
500 K plus. Okay, gotcha. So I mean at that rate we'd be looking at probably somewhere around 40,000 a month. Is that it?
No. Wednesday would be my day off from work and I shouldn't have any reason to not be there.
Sometimes landlords and prompting owners are not even in the same state, so they wouldn't even be able to do it
Oh, is that your zip code?
Okay. Yeah. Why 10,000 a month?
That's the only way that I got your contact is cuz it said you buy the book
Do you remember getting Brian Page's book on how to create financial independence Airbnbs about two, three months ago
Yeah, sorry. She <laugh> you's starting her squashing
Do that. Great. All right. Awesome talking to you. And I look forward to hearing how your call goes.
What I get with Social Security, 2000 a month.
That's what I need, action steps
I like to know everything there is about it before I start to delegate some of the responsibility out
O'clock on Wednesday, December 8th, right?
You too. You have a beautiful night.
Let's do that because I'm pretty sure it'll be all right
Yep. And are you trying to put all of your properties on Airbnb or it sounds like maybe a couple of those or long term rentals?
So on our team, we've actually got full-time executive consultants who are a lot more equipped at getting you results than I am
Scheduled? Scheduled later today if you have time or potentially tomorrow or next week, week.
So yeah, we have a big team here in Arizona but we've got some folks all around as well
And then just got busy and never followed up, never started, never picked it back up again
And so I'm excited we're gonna be able to help you to do that
More of an impact than you have on 'em now
So it is kind of passive but then it's, it's not so I like to roll up my sleeves and get out there
They work directly with Brian Page
Yeah. Sometimes a little accountability. Sometimes a little accountability is good, right?
Fully focused, no distractions like pen and paper
Cause you can't just pick up and go anytime you want
It's like 12 minutes long if I take the time to email it to you
Okay. All right. I love it. Sounds good. What's tomorrow looking like for you guys?
That's a great first step, man, that phone's gonna love to hear that
Seems like a handyman up in Wisconsin wants an arm and a leg to do any kinda work
Nice. And then, excuse me, what are you bring at home each year in annual income? From the
Later. See. Take it easy. Bye.
There's a lot of little things as you probably know, <affirmative>, but we like to own property
So that's why it's kind of in the background
I was wondering if you're at a hundred percent occupation almost if you raise your prices.
Deborah, this is Thomas with b B Formula from Brian Page's team
If you want me asking, man, what are you doing right now?
But that's the hard part about this thing
And just like a big old blank space on their calendars
Okay. And then annual gross income before taxes. What are you bringing home with the military right now?
Well, if I converted all my properties to Airbnb, it would be about a $60,000 a month income,
Gotcha. I'd say smartest guy in the world. 200, 2 50.
As far as method wise or approach on the business?
Bell? Yeah, sure did. <affirmative>? I did.
Noah, dude, I hope you have an awesome day and I'm really excited to see how this call goes through, man
Counts. Demand counts, man, I was double wrong.
So that's a big deal for me
That's, Dude, that's awesome to hear about your success so far
And I do have, I've kind of gone in a lot of directions
That you wouldn't be able to make it?
Okay, so it sounds good. If I can find some, find some time in their calendar, would you want to set up a call with them?
This is not, No, I'm not just gonna keep thinking about it
So I'm pretty much tired of it and just don't want to deal with it anymore
Okay. And how about tomorrow? Would you be able to do something early in the morning?
I'd just be visiting. I live with her for three years and I ain't trying to live with nobody else.
Most Yep, totally understand that. But like you said before, it's like it's about the free time, spending more time with family.
They're a small company right now, but they've been with us since the beginning and they've always helped us when we need things done
I remember getting one in the mail from Brian Page.
And what do you do for a living right now?
Be looking for that? Actually, the way we do it is you pitch the landlord on the idea
Is there any way at all that 11:00 AM on Saturday would work for you?
We scaled it up, it was like a dollar a week first, then I was scaling up $2,000 a week, $3,000 a week
I think I would take care of you
They are a bit brutal. Yes. That is a good way to put it. So anyway, so
Just wanted to triple check there
<laugh> <laugh>. Understand for sure. And are you able to help her out now?
I'm gonna send you a calendar and invite as well
She's older and we lost my brother last year
So given that, is that sound reasonable?
I don't think it's preparing that now.
So that's part of obviously what I told you with the lawyers and all that, with the kids
I'm gonna put you with Mr
I have no problems with my boss
Would you mind helping me fill it out really quick? Just a few questions
No, well I don't know that I do. Okay.
Yeah, I wouldn't mind jumping on a call and seeing what happens.
I mean I could rattle off a bunch <laugh>
So whether you should look for a furnish, unfurnished and what leases can you get approved for given your current situation
But this stuff, it doesn't just happen overnight. <affirmative> kind what get started now, Counselors, I have to calendar Google calendar.
I mean on our team we actually have full-time executive consultants who are a lot more equipped at get new results than I am
My dad's actually a psychologist as well at the va
Building always been something you've been striving for.
So the last thing I'm required to do is just fill out these three forms here three questions on a form so that Mr
I'm kind of busy right now
Yeah. Dwayne Foster 45 gmail com, right? Yep.
20 underscore. Okay. And then the best phone number to speak with the executive consultant on is the one we're talking on right now?
Okay. Yeah. Thanks for your sincerity and again, for your patience. Okay. And understanding, so you're very nice. Yeah, course. Which
Thank you much for calling and yeah, you'll have a great time with Noah tomorrow, okay?
We got a lot of crap going on here
Last year was probably a little different
Alrighty, nice talking to you man.
Looks like as she went through
Heck man, you're making 50 K a month, get tree houses every night if you want. Yeah,
I love to travel as well
Cuz really, I, I'm on calls every single day, so I speak to hundreds of people a month
I'll go ahead and text it over to you right now.
Sounds like you're, you're gonna watch it tonight? Oh, for sure
Okay, no worries. And then what's your gross annual income? Like a number you can actually verify with your tax return from last year?
I mean if we got an extra 8,000 thousand a year combined, that'd be phenomenal
No, I don't know exactly what it's at, but it's
Do you want me to share it?
A look on, That's the 18th Friday, right? What's a good time on Friday week from
If I don't work I don't get paid
Yeah, I agree. You're very, Yeah. Thanks for your sincerity. Yeah, that's true. Yeah,
It's definitely a good program when you think about it from that standpoint to be able to do it
So we have access to those and we paid for that and I, I've learned how to do that
And that's just working about two to three hours a week on top of what you're already doing
So you have that with you
So really I started in first one was January of last year and I stopped in November
I'm in Pasadena. I said, Oh, you were talking about where I'm at taking notes.
I talk to a lot of students who talk about traveling across sea and actually be going across the motor home across the country
<laugh>. It was a while back.
But yeah, that's definitely what I plan to do
It's definitely the mentality that goes into the first one and once it's going the rest typically come a little bit easier after that
<affirmative>, Yeah, now you got a lot going on
Now obviously if that's the case, well then that does require a higher level of investment
Pass down? Yeah. Yeah, I could. Yep. Absolutely.
I mean what would something for you personally,
Brian, does he work with Brian then?
Do all my research for Airbnb. I just cut my losses and quit
<laugh>, I mean, I really try not to use my credit card
Oh, tell me about that man. You said you're a music engineer, would you go full time with that and create your own label?
Sure. As long as it don't require my social.
Got you locked in for 7:00 AM tomorrow
You can just remind me this timing or nine 30 or 10 something that time. Yeah.
There would probably be a spouse, but I mean she's in South Carolina. I'm in Texas right now, so.
I didn't have a family then
And 10 is super like it's barely working, but at least you're still doing something <laugh>
You. No, of course not. Of course not. No
Just getting some better information and figuring out if this is something viable for you to do
I know I got a training meeting that's gonna should wrap up right around that time, but I'll be able to answer it regardless
Yeah, I got it now. I got it now. There were two different emails referring to the same event but I got, Did you see it
There for sure. I put some of it to you, so Definitely.
How much would you wanna be bringing in extra income per month?
And then they gotta be well off
Yeah. So I appreciate you taking the time, man, and I hope you have an amazing rest of your Saturday.
But yeah, that's just it for right now
You can get these in other places
Yes, I can plan my schedule around this for sure.
Okay. Question. Well, so what made you excited about Airbnb?
I mean it's still pretty, it's a lot to live with, but shit, it's what it is
Fun? I mean, I travel. Travel definitely. Yeah, definitely would travel.
Annual incomes around a hundred thousand
Funk to have some context around where you are as are
Do you mind helping me fill that out real quick?
And I like to retake definitely
And you can honestly do it faster than that
I don't know, 5,000? Not planning to stop.
Funk has the context that she needs to help figure out what you can get approved for
I had a lot of things going on at that time, obviously, so whole world in a pandemic
Well I'm just gonna enter your info in here on the scheduler and Javon, just really quick your last name King.
Some reason I think I have something scheduled for one o'clock and I just didn't write it down
So far? About three months. It's cuz I recently just came back from boot camp.
Cause I, it's a 10 acre property and wow
I'm happy to wait while you check out his schedule
It says Hyde Park, New York.
Renzi know that's what's going on
Stratton know that you're committed to watching that video and you'll be there at one 30
I think it's at just at the board of Between Good and Excellent seven 80 or something like that. I don't know exactly, but
Well I <crosstalk>. All right, well I
They have to do with how the student thinks and the specific mental models they operate with towards their Airbnb business
And because life is short, you want to go see them because
But I saw a couple places around that I was like, I'm gonna see how much they're gonna rent
Yeah, I'll email it and I'll also text it over to you as well.
Just be able to quit the nine to five.
And I'm curious, I talked to my brother actually a little bit about this
That's what everybody's asking for. Seven credit score,
What about tomorrow would you be able to do so tomorrow?
And they can lay out some steps of what needs to happen in order for you to get some results
There's gotta be certain locations which have a high profit, but I guess that's to figure out
You got Brian's course on the whole Airbnb business a while back
Hey Mike, this is Cooper with BNB formula. Brian Page's team. How you doing?
If not, it's like okay, well let's try something new
So I'm gonna send that video over to after this
I'm just taking down some notes to make sure that I'm getting what you're putting down here
In order to protect our executive consultant's time, especially Mr
So I mean, they regularly charge about a thousand dollars an hour for their Airbnb consulting
Okay, cool. Cool. That sounds a plan.
I moved here two weeks ago,
True though. Long time of, not what I mean, long time of not having wealth like that and stuff.
But will we be able to watch that all the way through before you speak with him on Friday?
Hey man. It's Thomas b b Formula from Brian Pages team. How you doing?
Maintenance, I got this job here to maintenance and maintenance
So you have a rental property right now that you're looking? Yeah
How long have you been working for them for
We could do some time in the afternoon
So do you know offhand just a ballpark of what your credit score would be?
I'll email that to you right after this
And again, Audra, if you don't want to do it for whatever reason, that's totally fine with me
No, it's really just a part of what we're doing
But even if they didn't think that you were a good fit for that, which unfortunately is the case for most people
I'm available pretty much every day the,
And at that point you're able to leave your job, you have more free time security
Stratton know you guys will be speaking on Friday
Just cuz I mean that wouldn't be fair to you
I know and I wanna listen and everything, but I don't, I don't know
So I'd be curious for you, was there something that got you fired up about Airbnb in the first place?
Send call back and let me know, give you my email too
Well, we'll see what we can do
And you should see a link in there to press add Google calendar. Do you see it?
But how does that sound? What are you thinking?
Smooth and stress for you man, that's like cool
It's actually a big reason why I'm reaching out
It's only like nine minutes long.
So I pay myself right at a thousand dollars a week
All right man. Right. Talk to you soon. Bye.
They're just gonna be vital in helping you identify how you can get your first Airbnb up and running
So for you mean, do you know what the number is that you put on your tax return last year for your annual income?
So would you mind watching that before your call?
It was just virtual personal training basically.
I mean where do you feel like you're at right now?
The, is that what you're saying?
That's great, I will tell her about that
Yeah, Group home and how you can have different ones
So I'll go ahead and confirm that point for you with Mr
It's about a 20 to send the little book and I'll send you the ebook as well and you can flip through that
I am over by Murray, Kentucky. I don't know if you know where it's at. Where are you calling today?
There's not gonna be that stress, that heavy weight pressing down your chest every day
And just so you know, the way this works, it's super simple
Oh, you said central time since you're gonna be in Texas, so, Yes
It says she has your booking confirmation on there
But it was very hard communicating with her
Where you enough to be around the property anymore
And now you're looking, so that's why you were interested in Airbnb
We'll leave it as just you then
So basically my job here is what we're doing right now is this big campaign
But I was gonna start one this year or I want to start one this year
Honestly that can be a good way to approach it
Okay. Is that before taxes or after? Oh, so you're probably making a little bit more before?
Well, here's kind of my thought process on this
You're already at a 10, you already have all the financial freedom that you want.
And I've got Jordan elite tech gmail
Okay, there's a start. Where are the kids?
Oh, we got it all taken out. I'm gonna put it back together tomorrow.
And that determines if the property owner will give you the lease for the property
It's like 30 minutes long, so it's packed with really good information to see
That's really any intentions of me doing anything is really for them and for my husband
I'm with Brian Page, Hopefully that name rings a bell for you
Okay. Gotcha. And did you go through that course at all and pull any value outta there?
So maybe there's a couple that are breaking even right now
Sunday comes a little bit too tough because I will get a lot of disturbance up there in San Francisco, even though I,
And I'd honestly ever hate for you to ever have to pay that
A lot of the coaches that we have on our team are really good at that
So I could put you in contact with him and just kind of set you up on his calendar
And you guys will obviously go deeper on the call, but just for now and then just one last thing before your call, Mr
So we just take a look at the credit and stuff like that and just your overall financial profile
Anytime. Yeah, you have a great rest of your weekend. All right. Or we, Excuse me.
They're just gonna look at a few different things, of course that can determine what you can actually get approved for
So unfortunately for these, we're actually only able to book these about 48 hours or so out in advance for whatever reason
Yeah, it's, It's not good <inaudible>. It's either 6 52 or 22. I think it's six.
Usually people don't invest for, you invested a thousand dollars into the course, you obviously went out and got properties
Yeah. So do you guys have anything in the morning?
And so this one last thing we're required to do is fill out this little form
What you have in the afternoon?
No. No, I'm not land adopted,
I like the operate that way
If I send that over to you before the call, could you give that a watch?
Kind of hit a couple road blocks with my business, current business
So I'm super excited to see how it goes
Well, that's cool, man. I love that you said that
So that's just the way that we found can be the best for us and also the best for you guys as well
Is there any reason at all you make the call? I know you're busy and honestly Dana's been busy as well
I mean, here's kind of my thought process on this
Looks like I was able to get you in with Mr
No, you're all good. Hey do you know where your credit score is at?
Like I said, I'm unemployed currently, so I've got nothing but free time so many days soon. Works for me.
I was saying what's the ideal monthly income you're hoping to get to with Airbnb?
Okay. I've got one o'clock or a two o'clock in the afternoon I could pull off.
Oh yeah, definitely. So maybe early retirement earlier than the traditional 65 or so guys's Verizon. Right,
Six is pretty late, but even five's pretty late. Let
Right now what I'm at, I'm only, truthfully, I'm only about at 3000 sometimes cause of Covid and everything
Brown know you'll be watching that video and I look forward to hear to hearing how it goes for you
I'm gonna email that to you right after this and you're able to watch that tonight before you speak with them tomorrow
Cause right now we've set ourselves to a certain level of living to where this is what it is, this is what we make
So just like a ballpark range
Oh wow. That's a surprise. Took a call from BNB Formula.
I guess it's not the financial freedom but more so the time. Having more time to do what I want.
Now I have to take a look at their calendars first, but how does that sound?
So 25 in savings, two month in security or social security
People. Yeah. I bring to you.
But I don't know if I'm gonna put all towards Airbnb, but I'd like to get one or two going at least
Yeah, I wouldn't mind talking to somebody
Once you have all this money and the investments, I mean, what's the ultimate goal for you? What do you really want?
He's in he told my manager that 12 months in, he's about 13 or 14 months into his journey now at this point
You have to do the conversations with him in person and then show him the information
And then just one last important thing before we hop off
<laugh>. Yeah. And basically you go up there and you can get Airbnb properties around there,
I mean, I wouldn't put up everything I got
All right, looks like we got you in with Mr
I'd love to tell you how we're helping people three to $20,000 extra per month in passive income
You could call me a business guy
Cause we've really never done this before and I'm not sure if we're gonna do it again
You know what I mean? It's like rekindling that fire I have towards B, B or Airbnb
But sounds like you'd be able to make that happen, so it shouldn't be an issue for you
I think it's the next step in our career
And so the most important thing for me is to free up my time
That's really what I was trying to get into it for long
And now I think I can build it up to a few hundred units, whether it be through ownership or arbitrage or management
I mean, first and foremost is to give myself out of that college debt
And so Douglas, I'll give you a quick refresher on the Airbnb model
I said saying that sounds amazing
And then the second thing to look at is annual income
So go. And then Gregory A. Johnson?
That's kind of what I wanted to do with the Airbnb, but that was gonna be one of the things that I was doing
Which one of that is it more for you?
Hell yeah, one of my good buddies from college actually lives out there as well
Cool. I just texted you my backup or your backup rather, so if you wanna confirm that that's correct.
Stabler so I will let him know that you guys will be beating next week and be watching those videos
It looks better for us and for Brian Page
Well, tomorrow I've got 9:00 AM tomorrow and then on Friday my latest is a 5:00 PM I also have a 9:00 AM
Would you be open to that?
And once again, I like to learn about B and bs <affirmative>
So you said you, you're starting your own clothing brand right now and you wanted to focus on that
Yeah, I could arrange that one 30.
Let you know if something happens that only an emergency, if that happens. Same goes for you if there's an emergency, of course.
Don't want to go there anymore
And especially Chicago itself seemed like it was a bad idea
Would you mind watching that before, before your call today?
<laugh>. You get it man. You get it
But the trucking industry is really stressful
So yeah, I've got different structures
Say you did that right? You reinvested, Yeah
Yeah. So I'm gonna go ahead and send you over a calendar invite to Jonathan Dot. How do you pronounce your last name?
So I guess fair enough be around it the more they'd be like Tory
I believe so. Arizona's Mountain time, but sometimes we go on our own schedule, which is weird, but I believe we're in Mountain Time,
Probably the later one would be better for me.
Cooper. I'll shoot you a text right after this. Okay?
I'll give you a little quick little refresher
So long term goal, if possible, would be to convert everything and then you could be doing a significant amount more per month?
And just to double confirm before I lock you in here for four o'clock Eastern time tomorrow, good for that
Yeah, man, that's awesome. And Wally, what else would you do for your mom if you were making 50 K a month?
Gotcha. Now how long have you been doing that for?
If a staging everything, it does cost money
Gotcha. So what are you doing right now?
So I was reading a text message from somebody
Yeah, you got it. The first property in your own house, are you guys looking to start scaling it to other properties?
I mean you can call me anytime Saturday
All right, awesome. So Travis, is there any reason why you wouldn't be able to make that call on Friday? Just cuz time they have and
So it helps with everything else I got going
Well are you just calling me about the coaching, getting the one on one coaching at home?
And some of these jobs you just can't afford to pay on that
And so sometimes that's a little bit of guidance
That come from never here. That's a really unique last name.
Okay. That's what I'm talking about. That's it. They shooting up. Be walking around with not a lot of clothes. <laugh>. Yeah.
You're welcome. You too. Bye. Have a.
Full-time employed, Let me put that differently
Oh, I like visit places, all of the country, Paris, France, stuff like that.
Awesome man. Have a nice day.
So are you said you're driving, when are you driving during the day
What are you working with right now?
I don't know, but just within myself, just wanting me to be successful.
No, yeah, definitely. I'll be there. I'll be good.
So in a perfect world, no boundaries
Now I do have to take a look at their calendars first, but how does all that sound? Yeah,
Here's something that you can do
Put the right thing in here.
Hey, this is Thomas with B Formula
Right now what I do is work
So on a scale from one to 10, how much do you have the words? Awesome and independence at 150.
We can do it over the phone
Yeah, I mean I've been interested in real estate for, let's see, 30 years now I guess, and Okay
Liquidate some properties and got deals on the table.
Okay. For sure. It wouldn't be happy with 2000 bucks a month. No, I sure as hell would be.
I have a few questions, but it sounds like it could work
<laugh>. Indeed man. Indeed. And so how often do you get travel? Right now
Yes, this is Yes. Yes is.
You can watch it right after this
I can tell just you seem like a smart guy. And so we have Tuesday, we have a couple time slots open on Tuesday.
You want me to break down how that call would go and see if I can find some availability in the calendar?
Those are some just personal things from my life that are really a struggle right now, <laugh>.
Okay. How long have you been doing that for?
I know I talked so many brain right now
I don't know if I have enough time for that or money, frankly
He started with his own apartment instead of renting out one of the rooms, his apartment
Before 11:00 AM Okay. So I know we got daylight savings coming up, so this is a little tricky here.
The video is very important, so just go ahead and watch that before you speak with him
If you can schedule something over the weekend, that'll be a lot better
I love that. Where do you feel like the drive to do that comes from
People are not living in it as much
I say me comfortably, comfortably just grabbing money, just putting it out
Hey Tara. How's it going? This is Cooper. I'm with Bmb formula on Brian Page's team.
Okay, Understood. And then what's your gross annual income, the number you'd put on your tax returns last year?
For example, I got in there yesterday and I have a, I'll use one property as an example
We'll see, I get a majority of my pay is in per diem, so my taxable income is less than half of that.
Unless they approve it and then they approve it, then you, you're like, hey, I'm gonna use this for business
Check out. But then I'm waiting for Diane to email me.
12:00 PM Friday is perfect. Yep.
Would seven o'clock tonight be too soon?
You obviously said right there, you know, said you're good for that
My only thing thing is as of right now at this very moment I'm trying to get out is money pit
So they all went through Brian's like mentorship and then started to teach others how to do it
Are you curious at all? Do you want me to share that?
The only other thing, like I said is Mr
So you've seen it happening a lot. Some of the different areas you're looking at.
Okay. All right. So now I understand why it was so important for me to build up my business credit.
To travel around? Cause that's probably one of the things that we haven't got to do
So I'm so open this up and circle back a super solid idea of how I can help you
It's about 80 grand a year
I don't have much going on unless I'm on, That's when I get busy
Rogers know what the deal is and yeah, we'll talk to you soon, Li l
I said, Look, you need to get tough with these people, <laugh> in a real estate business
So last thing I'm required to do is just fill out a little form for Mr
And it'd be nice to have them get them involved in as well sort of start a little family out of it
The year. Okay. 200,000 for the
If you would please. Yes. <laugh>, that'd be helpful.
This is b and B formula with Brian Page
All right, well man, we'll keep in touch.
It makes sense and it's super thorough, but it's just a matter of jumping in and making that first step
So I'm always asking people like, Hey, where would you go? You know what I mean?
I have to make sure we're all on board too, so it's a make that function too
I mean that would be awesome. Of course.
I'm just gonna ask you a few questions you don't need to fill
And so tomorrow at five 30 you're saying, right?
Well they, they're 7, 16, 25.
So the idea behind it is to replace the income so that we can do other things
We will go ahead and get you in there with Don, Mr
So yeah, Hold on one second please
So just make sure everyone's time is being respected and you get what you need to really be successful with this
Part of the reason why I'm calling, we're doing this big push right now
Looking at? Maybe five to $7,500.
You got, I'm trying to, I've been doing good with my calorie
They may be able to get you some legitimate real deal PNLs from some people doing this right now your
Let's do seven 30 this evening
So that's actually where you go to landlords and you sign a lease with them or you can partner with them
That that's a great place to be
One called, was it Job one? We just did the sample workout. We were gonna start, I guess Megan Davies program pretty soon too.
Someone telling you, well this or that or try this or that. Hey this is the program, do this and go <laugh>.
Of course you of you don't know what you don't know and that's totally normal
No, I'm sorry. I'm talking to Yeah, it's driving right now. Making sure we are on central time.
The ones just doing the bare minimum but still had success
Okay. And this a ballpark here, but what's your current annual income?
But will you guys both be able to watch that all the way through before speaking with one of our guys?
Really the key right there man
And then Monday we'll totally, we're opening the nutrition club as a complete remodel
Yeah, we wanna make sure you watch it and you can forward it to your business partner as well
Like I said, I made a one 20 and I made 120, I brought in as additional 70,000, just renegotiate my contracts
And let me tell you what, the book is great
And then again, that'll be fully I funded Lady Moment, Show up the call that'll start processing that
My girl caught it twice, two or two or three times cuz she don't listen
And so I'm excited we gotta connect and have this conversation
Won't be fair for you guys
It's just a little form that I'm required to fill out
Okay. What email do you have for me?
I think we'll probably set up a date
Okay. You want your family or whoever else to remember that you did something you've sac made sacrifice and you've been able to provide for them
Sure, that's it. That's the one.
Here's kind of my thought process behind this
So make sure I'm understanding you correctly
Do you have any properties of your own?
Would that be something you'd potentially be interested in?
So what if I could do this for you since you already are a student that's invested with us back in July
I, I really just put it at a halt to be all the way honest
I didn't actually have the means to go out and be successful right away
You got it. You do the same. Talk to you soon.
We're doing this massive push to reach out to anyone that purchased something from us and then hook them up with,
Awesome. So you for sure be able to go through that, take some notes before the call at seven o'clock tonight?
Sometimes you don't even have to purchase the furniture and you can just split the profits with them
I got a property cuz I wanted to do it
We've had a lot of people who haven't really been able to get started yet
Awesome. So first question, what's your credit score?
Now, which time zone are you in?
Yeah. So I have, the schedule is open for today, tomorrow, Friday and Saturday.
Okay. Do you happen to know what your credit score is? Ballpark?
You actually can say that you have a property and it changes the pitch completely and it changes the atmosphere completely
Especially with everything going on with them trying to make us do what we don't necessarily wanna do.
I mean, out of the people that have gotten started, I mean they've just had incredible success
Yeah, the numbers we seen right now with our students and our higher end programs, the, we've actually documented the results
We have to leave the schedule open for the paid consultations
Looks like through on our side
You can actually go out to landlords and property owners and pitch the idea to them of them renting the property to you
Does that make sense, <affirmative>? No, that's totally fair
So it looks like that spot is open for 1:00 PM tomorrow
So it's been quite the journey
And then for a living, would you just say, what would you say you do for a living?
I mean, like I said, who knows
I know it's gonna take somewhere, but I don't mind the work
I've done numerous types of real estate strategies
And then when leasing properties, that should be listing on Airbnb
Yeah, I income month Airbnb. How much would you
Obviously that is the case that does require a higher level investment
I mean, I just needed a catalyst to get that kicked off and I don't anticipate that getting much better
They're literally the best in the business
One second. Can you hear me?
That's why I like the idea of Touro and Airbnb cuz they're passive but you still gotta work at them
So thinking like $10,000 profit a month,
Martinson. M A R T I N S E n.
I have available limit, yeah, I got space. Okay,
I, and I need to get a new clean
But trying to keep focused, keep steady, it's gonna come gonna, I just gotta be ready for it
Oh nice. What do you do right now?
Yeah, Sorry, Does that bring a Yeah man
Let me pull up the schedule for or Sunday here
Okay. Here is a Visa and it's Murphy Associates P as in Patricia.
And that's something I could work with
So I have it in bred, I have it in everything
I'll send you a text on my cell number
From my personal or from Airbnb?
Right. All right, looks like it says
So what would be a good time for her on Friday if you're pretty open?
I need to, honestly, Cooper, honestly, I, I'm through piddling around man right now
Looks like here you got Brian's book while back about starting an Airbnb business, then actually owning the property
I don't know if I making sense
Before the call on Saturday, there's just a quick five minute video from Brian explaining sort of his system you
Yeah, like I said, I guess the hour couldn't hurt have a conversation,
I would buy more investment properties. I'd make my husband quit his job, put my kids in private school. Really?
Does any of that sound like it would
He's, we buy and sell real estate notes
So that's where it peaked my interest
But I don't find that kind of offering here on fifth
So yeah the door's open still
And a lot of times it's not really about you, it's about them
You can basically go on vacation and write it up, can't you?
Yeah, I mean don't any reason why I couldn't be on, take a phone call for 20 or 30 minutes at least
Thought, Oh yeah, that will totally happen. Absolutely happen.
It'll be better than reading through the book, better than talking to me
Hey Jay, this is Thomas. Oh, we spoke briefly earlier. Jay, can you hear
As long as you have a ballpark range kind in 700 s, that's, that's definitely a solid range to go properties with
No, I would want it to replace my income.
So let me just tell you what I've got available and we can see if we can work something out
Right now we're doing the cleaning ourselves and working different jobs and when we get there, hopefully everything's on
Hey Bic, this is Cooper with Bmb Formula. I'm Brian Page's team. How are you?
And we're seeing at on average a two to three to three x return on rent for Airbnb
I, I'm gonna talk to a consultant really quick just to make sure that we can get you on her calendar
Would you be opposed to hopping on that
It was over 60 hours a week
In profit from what you're currently doing. But for you,
Yeah dude. I mean I've been there too.
Even if it's in stocks or crypto right now?
And then just one day saw Brian's thing and he was like, Oh, sends you a free book
I'm investing it in more things and kind of building that generational wealth
Awesome. Tuesday at 5:00 PM your time?
They're gonna look at a few different things that can determine what you can get approved for
Well, I have a house already that I was thinking about, but I had my sister move into it
We just got our fifth property, but I like what he does
It would just make life easier
You're welcome ma'am. Bye bye. Right.
Are there some good projects or charities or stuff that you could put money into and that would feel good for you?
I am not asking for any bank to approve me for anything I want to do
Gotta hold. It's almost counterproductive at that point. You got a new mic but you gotta hold it closer to your mouth. So
So what would you do if you had an extra 20 to $30,000 a month coming in just from Airbnb? What would change for you?
Contract? And then that would definitely be the case with somebody who's looking to sell
That's all I context that our executive consultant needs to figure out what's best for you
Right after this? I'll send it to that email.
And that grounding to get the money together
It's about seven 20, something like that
I mean to get it be able to leave my job and do Airbnb full time, that would be the end goal
Yeah, it sounds like LI'S is not something that you wanna keep doing that longer. How long have you been living with there?
Well, yeah, I mean it's not really about some of the nice things you can buy
So I just use that you just thing cause that's my email address Java King
What I did was, I started a trucking company back in April l Davis Logistics
Yeah, I mean there's been a couple shifts here
So I'll let the consultant know that you guys are getting the mortgage right now
Like I said, as far as long term, I want as many income streams as I can
Yeah, it's not gonna be an issue.
Yeah, I'm excited for you. And also one last thing. It sounds like you're doing this with your husband potentially or business partner? Yes,
Well yeah, because I got my wife. Yeah. Helps me and that's how she we're both working together so that's great.
We do it a little bit differently now
If something was to happen to me obviously take back my time which is valuable, your time's valuable
I have no idea. I'd have to see that <laugh>.
So it makes it a little more challenging
Why is Arizona calling me nigger? Word.
You might be, There could be a couple issues with your lifting, potentially the positioning of the photos
Gotcha. Okay. Talk to me about some of the profit you've been seeing month over month with these two properties. You said profit
Well, I mean, everybody's offering that now
I just had a family there, came from Minnesota and they stayed a week
But I went to a school in Georgia and when I went there I really didn't know much about finances before that
If you rented a place out for a thousand dollars a month, you're gonna get two to $3,000 a month in booking on Airbnb
You're flipping houses and you're a real estate agent, you got a marketing agent
What I would see 300,000, like a year or a month
So know definitely some obstacles but sounds like some things that could possibly be overcome
Absolutely free of charge. I'm all on board
In what time zone are you're Minneapolis, are you east coast or central?
And yeah, if I can do that and just make sure I provide even when I'm dead, they'll still be good
So the first step is having the confidence that it can actually work
Is there anything else stopping you from being successful?
About a half a million a year.
And so dude, these guys regularly charge like a thousand bucks an hour for their Airbnb consulting <affirmative>
I love that you immediately want to help your family and help them financially and get them retired
Yeah, I think that was when I get home, I live
And so I'm just curious for you, what are you interested in Airbnbs in the first place?
All right. Tell me your name again.
<affirmative>. Gotcha. And did you have any specific goals in mind of how much more you wanted to bring in with Airbnb or another opportunity?
I'll go ahead and email that to you right after this
Okay. How much you time do you spend on those things that you're passionate about and giving back now?
I use it for Airbnb, but I didn't get into the Airbnbs and I'm still line to do it
Fantastic, Thanks for asking. Just trying to change the world.
So were you able to get started with Airbnb or what's going on? We
And so this has just been growing organically on the side
They're literally the best in the business
And just with any business really, it's first things first
All right, so we have limited availability for tomorrow
Yep, I got it. No, I understand.
Thomas. Okay. I got my brother-in-law name Thomas. I can't forget that.
So I'm curious, where are you at in your journey so far?
So let's just get right to it cuz I'm a busy guy and we don't need to talk around a whole lot
If you're on the call, not gonna cost you a dime.
I wanted to just pay the rent or make it break even and I'm living in the spot myself
Would it be nicer to be on the beach? Sure
Yeah, sounds like you're absolutely swamped
So yeah, I would say I'm making two grand a month right now about that much
That's a great amount to get started with
He's got 14 properties and he is netting, so he is profiting $25,000 a month
And I mean they're light years ahead of me
Where are you currently with it?
Yeah, I've noticed there's been a couple cities who are pushing forward some pretty tough regulations
Oh really? Why so low? Yeah,
Put my name in there and let's keep in touch, man
I really enjoyed talking with you and I look forward to seeing how it goes
Cool. Now I'd have to look at their calendar first but that sound
Hey look, I don't know if you remember or not, but it looks like you got Brian's book a while back
That's awesome man. And for you, cuz people have a lot of different motivations for this type of stuff why is traveling important to you?
Yeah, I'm just working the next couple days
Like I said, we're doing the cleaning now and then just replying, communicating with guests and stuff like that
I wanna get you this information and how that you need
Right? If you got to 2000 a month, you wouldn't stop there
Let's see here what we have for the three o'clock
Eddie Speed had a hedge fund
I think he said his mother or is grandmother is French and him taking the last name
Awesome. You mentioned music. You said music was the first thing you said.
I understand that that could be super demanding in the hospital and the hours are really crazy
Gotcha. Okay. Would you be back from picking them up at four weeks before today?
It would be after seven Eastern time
Well, like I said in the evening, what we say? Five o'clock? Something like that.
Again, I don't have a specific time
And then as far as just cash or checkings saved up that you could actually put towards the business, do you have anything there?
I didn't think there's a program out there I haven't invested on
Smith? Just cuz our executive consultants are extremely busy and if he says you wouldn't show up, it doesn't make me look very good
Positive home solutions.com that's the one for you?
A lot of them are just worried they're not gonna get it
He's got 30 properties, almost all entirely rental arbitrage
So in a perfect world, no boundaries
Man. I've been delayed on it though.
I'm gonna send you the video ebook
Parties work for you right now? You said you got the course, you haven't started it
So I'm logging in right now to my PayPal account
But I do have a little bit of power here
Cool. Any other questions for me?
And so those are the two important numbers
Fun that context as well, man
So until I actually go back to work with the union, I'm pretty much free
And 81,000? If I can keep up to 17, two hours a week. Hey it'll be 81,000.
Well I'll let this funk know you're watching that and enjoy the rest of your day
So that's been consuming a lot of my time
So it's like we just try to recoup 10% of that
Oh, well then if there's hotels and ins, then there's hospitality, then there's people coming and going and there's a college town
Yeah, I'd for sure do that.
You like three years, four years,
It's G like in George, C like in Charlie, T like in Tango, R like in Romeo
All right, talk soon. Bye-bye. All right.
If it doesn't work, then I'm willing to cut my tie
I believe it's at 700 currently. It might be 7 0 4, but I believe it's should be
And can your girlfriend be on the call as well so that she's not left out?
I can already tell I do see some serious opportunity in helping you
Idealistic money, people would just waste that
And I can do the sales job while I work in electrical sales
It's kind of like that tipping point <affirmative> just getting over the edge
Yeah, it was a while back
I'm skeptical about specifically because of Coronavirus and everything being shut down for the last two years
But obviously at some point you're interested in Airbnbs
So it is kind of like, yeah, it's kind of killing two birds at one stone I guess
If it 50 hours a week or 60 hours a week or it's hours, this's not gonna work
So I mean if these guys are interested in doing something on the weekend, that's cool with me
Well the people here, they actually, they help a lot of people but the calendar calendars are pretty booked up
Right? That's But where do I get started? How do I find deals? That's been my biggest question,
Now, let me ask you a question. Do y'all have resources on how to promote the affiliate program?
The goal is basically that we have every given year, we've got a hundred thousand dollars of free cash flow coming from those properties,
Well, I'll tell you what Greg Cause we get it right
Cause you have income coming in every time all the time
Yeah, I was interested in dabbling into real estate and marketing and doing business that way as well. Gotcha. As well as running my own business
So for me, I know it's possible
So noon and then afternoon's wide open
And I know you, I said this could take three or four years before you can really relax and get it up and running
One of 'em was a female and she was like, she's currently doing Airbnb during the whole Covid process
I mean, we've even got one gal who's up in Seattle, Washington, and she's not purchasing any property
I'm actually in the middle of lunch here
Gotcha. So you're searching for something new, something different,
Okay, Justin, I'll lock it in, send you a calendar invite, shoot you over some emails that you can just forward to your girlfriend. Okay.
And so basically the process will be started as soon as you show up to the call
Know, do realize that, I don't know what the heck you're talking about, right?
Something I came up with, but I don't know, it could be shorter, but it was just something that came up real quick
So here's what I'll do right now
Don't really have a number stuck in my head, but
But for you specifically, why is that important to you?
Okay, cool. Cool. And so do you have that rental, is that your only rental property or do you have others as well?
Yeah. On a scale of one to 10.
Although I do think the question on how much I make a year is the wrong question
Not all of 'em are shows, but most of them do
Sweet. Yeah, I did read his book and I don't know, I honestly don't know what stopped me. <laugh>.
You know what I said 5 5 45
I've been doing it for a long time and it's just time to shift
2000 cash. And is that something you could potentially use for a business or do you need that for bills and groceries coming up?
These guys are a lot more to get a lot more equipped to get results than I am
Order, let's find a time here in the next couple days I'll send you a video
So, So why don't we do this? I have a really cool pre-call video that I'll have you watch before
Okay, cool man. So I've actually got a three 30 tomorrow Eastern time. You free at that time?
Maybe that little push that you need I think sounds like somebody maybe yourself gave yourself a little push already recently, right?
So it sounds like you still nuclear path.
So real estate was one of the best investments
Hey, this is Thomas with b B Formula
But once you do that, then it's like, let's get it right
Okay. Well what would you do with an extra 20 to $30,000 a month coming in?
I was checking in because I'm actually a manager on the student success team here for Brian based
It's one of my favorite things to hear from our students and one of my favorite parts about the job
All right. Sounds good. Sophia. Good getting to know you. And we'll talk on Friday for a couple minutes.
What's my credit score? Oh, it's probably seven 40.
So I just can't jump out there and stop and stop just working at my <affirmative> main job
So Shta right now you said you're in disability, you're basically recovering from stay in the hospital
Yeah, if it's free. I mean anytime you can talk to someone that knows more than you, it's always a benefit. It's always a benefit.
Let's just put that as just a little micro commitment there
So I mean since say 400,000, that sounds more of what we would only be shooting for
So I'll foresee a reason why I couldn't get it
It'd have to be, I don't know
I just like more passive income
Totally. Yeah, for sure. Did you think about, do you remember the rental arbitrage model Brian talked about in the course?
Benal know you're fully committed to watching that video
If I didn't have kids I would be okay
Okay. Let me see what I can do on Thursday. You said Thursday? Thursday afternoon would be alright?
<laugh>. Well it's awesome. Well, Jerry, tell me about this. What's been keeping you from getting started?
Yeah, if you can make that, that would be great
They're getting paid about a thousand dollars just for a single 60 minute consulting session
Oa, cuz you guys will probably be able to dive pretty deep into strategy Airbnb stuff
I mean, I could help my cleaning crew
Well that's just income. That's right. That's just income coming in. So I have mortgage payments or association dues and all of that kinda stuff. Right.
And when it does come in, you're gonna see two emails
Okay, I'm looking reservation. Okay, so doesn't appear to have come just yet. Maybe me check by
I send you, I'm gonna, the video
Okay, gotcha. And then are you on an iPhone or Android?
Yeah, you wanna have something that is there for you for that security, but also can give you a little bit extra if needed
Do you mind just helping me fill that out real quick? Just a couple questions
So it's kind of a win win win
And I immediately thought of it as an easy way to make side money, side hustle
And then I paid That's fair
Three bedroom, two and a half bath
But I was actually just talking to my manager about a guy who had purchased a course but he hadn't really gotten started
We actually started he started with us about 12, 13 months ago in February of last year, 2021
Hey Robert. It's Cooper with Bmb Formula. I'm Brian Pages team. How you doing?
21. I, I've worked a lot.
Hey, can you hear me? Oh, hey, it's Thomas. It's Thomas with b B Formula from Brian Page's team. How you doing?
So I'm gonna be on a little conference call tomorrow at 1:00 PM
Were you making a profit or anything?
And then just a few more things before we wrap it up here for Mr
Are you able to watch that before you speak with him at three 30?
I'll go ahead and send it over the counter invite to you now just so you can accept it after you hop off
That I can know of off the top of my head in this area. Yeah, fine.
I'll get you finalized in here on our side
The only other last thing before your call is Mr
Yeah. I like to go to Cancun, maybe Cabo or Florida or somewhere.
I can tell you that right now
I mean, I just came across it in an article I think, and I was doing some research on real estate and stuff
I mean, I could do it, I'd have to get something else
Do you want me to share it?
And so within nine to 10 months at that same rate you'd be looking at around $10,000 per month in profit
Hey, with Bmb formula on Brian Pages team. How you doing today?
Wait, wait, you said 10:00 AM
Hey <crosstalk>. Hey, can I for a second?
We've watched it happen in front of us
There's people that say you got to say you got to 10 K a month with the Airbnb business
I wanna go visit the Panama Railroad
Okay. Right. Okay. All right. Well I guess I will hear back from you then, you and or Diane, what, probably next week?
I just sent over calendar invite, so feel free to accept that after the call
Awesome. But what would you do there? I've never been to Greece either. And so like me
<affirmative>. Well when you say financial freedom, what do you mean by that?
That is an awesome story and we love to identify some of our success stories here
I'm gonna go ahead and reach out to Dan because honestly that's unacceptable from our side
This is my first conversation that anybody decided to talk to me about this
And so I'm just taking out loans
When I was with the union, I had good insurance and now that I haven't been working, there's no insurance
So those are my two problems
And they can lay out what needs to happen in order for you to get results
And so it breaks it down very simply
What would be that ideal balance for you?
I mean, do you have more than 10 that you could access?
Which one of that is it more for you?
That's the smart thing to do, honestly i's
Typically we see just some rough numbers and estimates
And I mean, there's a tons of ways to get creative
Okay, gotcha. And how much did you wanna mix from Airbnb? Did you have a goal set already?
Yeah let me check really quick
That's not one of my cousins. No it's not one of my cousins. No
So I definitely think based on that, you definitely could probably be squeezing out another you
I'm not feeling very independent since I'm still strapped to a job. I would say I about a three or a four.
So what time zone will you be in when you'll be home next week?
I love that you said that
I mean, again, I think I would like to get it maybe two to six figure income over time.
I think you would keep going
Let me get some context on where you're at now as far as passive investments
Awesome. That is sick. I love to see that. Love to hear that from some <affirmative> you at this point.
And after that we can say cuz our daughter has graduated college is and has begun her life on her own
No, I do have to take a look at the consultant's calendar first, but how does all that sound?
We're basically trying to help here reach out
It's like seven 30 or seven 40 or something
Sure. Yeah, that's fine. I can do that.
Just talking to a buddy yesterday
Know? Well, my goal, yeah, my goal is really to create my own resort
Those are things that I don't want to feel in my life
I'm gonna waive the fee so there's no charge for the call
I run into a lot of people who simply can't get rid of their tenant, haven't collected rent in two years, <laugh>
They can help you figure out the leads and any other options like that
Live on that beach and I'm a old man now, man
Would love it. How sad do you think she'd be? Would she be proud of you?
Yeah. All good, all good. But I'm just curious, what are you interested in Airbnbs in the first place
Greg, I look forward to hearing how it goes for you
I mean I think it might just be my lack of experience with sales <laugh>
One of the main things I do with a lot of my free times, so I totally feel you there
<affirmative> is one of them, Orange is another one
Within six months you're at $6,000 a month, and at 12 months you're at $12,000 a month
I mean it's been a long time because I mean I've not really had to use it in a while apart from credit card
Catherine Funk and she's legitimately one of the top people who work here and really, really good at what she does
Nada. Do you know where any of your cars may be since it basical of you funded? So it won't like
It'll be 60 minutes. I also have an 11:00 AM.
Yeah, well you sound like an awesome guy
But I really do enjoy a hard copy book
I've been wanting to do it now
And so yeah, he's, in terms of how close he works with Brian, he works closer
Oh dude, I was work on finishing the book tonight just because of his car <laugh>. I was like, I'll,
Jacob. Hey Jacob. This is Cooper. I'm with Airbnb Formula. I'm on Brian Page's team. How's your Thursday treating you?
You're in the hospital right now?
So $5,000 a month and it sounds like you have some pretty strong motivation to build this back up
I gotta cook breakfast with my son and get him off to school here in a few or
These guys are a lot more equipped to get your results than I am
And I'm not gonna quote you exactly, but you can look up and see the package I got
That's exactly where my head is at
My current credit score is a 6 89, close to 700, 709 6 89.
All right. That sounds good. Thank you.
And then I've got chris dot w dot harmon hotmail
And I, I'd hate for you to ever have to pay that
I just don't know how it's gonna turn out
Can't do anything about it, you know, just gotta live with it and try to learn from it
So how much available capital do you have to put into deposits on leases for properties?
That is always my goal every single month off of every property
Four. Probably 40 per day job. 1520 for real estate.
Rob Smith know that you'll be watching that and it's only 12 minutes long so it'll be a quick one
Understood. And is that everything that you're working with total, like checkings or savings?
Can you accept it really quick?
I'll make sure to let Mr
They work directly with Brian Page himself
And basically what they can do for you is kind of dive deeper into exactly where you are with your Airbnb journey
Not a doubt in my mind
Gotcha. Okay. So one o'clock and do you have about 45 minutes available at one o'clock?
But there's ways around to get money, there's business credit, there's all types of stuff
Stratton will be giving you a call from his work line, it won't be recognized
Yeah, it's an early flight. I got an hour and up to Charlotte and yeah, it's an early flight.
But then also kind of freeing you up a little bit
Me just open up. So you think more of a three or four?
All right, cool. Not a problem.
Then if it's lucrative and I can say I make money in it, then I'm willing to actually expand more
And honestly for a lot of our students they don't even get offered that
So I'm curious, so what got you excited about Airbnb?
Yeah, I mean for sure I definitely would
Oh, okay. It said Kansas call, so I didn't <laugh> know what that was, but anyway, for some it's
Man, my life took a different route
I could do something, my morning appointments are 11 or 1130 and then I've got pretty much anything in the afternoon
And it's a total different business model than what you're doing with the long term buy and hold
Okay, let's do the 11 and I'll touch bases with her. And if you're gonna send that video to me, right
So first it would be me and then he would come along
I mean you can say it however you want man. It's Guzman,
It's just getting the ball on the roll, so to speak
It'll come from cooper page BNB formula
Stratton does make sure that everybody that I place on his calendar watches a short pre-call video beforehand, just takes a few minutes
So what kind of got you interested in Airbnb to start out?
So wait, so what I do is, Oh, when I get ready, do I just come on here and
But apart from that, thank you for calling me
How do you know that? Where does the data come from?
Can you give your name again? I have to prove this, I have to say this. My colleague.
I don't need anything firm. If you just have a ballpark or of what's available, checking, savings, something somewhere liquid?
Hey, this is Thomas with b and b formula
So until that comes out probably maybe three or 4,000 at
I don't have a business plan, so I don't know
I, I sound young, but I'm not
Okay. For you? I'll do it. <laugh>.
Range. Then I bought the other programs connected with it.
You guys are home settled, ready to go at the start time
Or Perfect actually, I mean do you have a recommendation or a preference or is it the same either way?
So anyways, Yeah, I think so
And looking at some of the folks that already have properties and who already been successful, you know, can get to shoot
Well, let me ask you this man a thousand or $2,000 is no small thing to invest
Which would it do those work for you?
Lancer. It's spelled l a n c e r.
I'd rather be doing something else to be honest. <laugh>.
Yeah, I'm put it one second
So that's all I really look for
I mean, what are you shooting for? What's kind of that monthly income that you're hoping to get to with an Airbnb business?
So that'd probably bring you in an extra 1600 to $2,000 a month turning into Airbnbs
6 million in his Airbnb portfolio this year, <affirmative>
Let me see if I can get you confirmed in here
Yeah. It was a while back, right?
Okay. I got DSA t Montana gmail.com.
Like I said, I'd say having that time to do what I want and if I could automate it, that would be the end goal.
Okay. And do you know your credit score
So I really don't know how to answer your question
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Actually no, not tomorrow. This would be on Wednesday.
He has about 30 units and he's not working much at you
Nope. By four o'clock tomorrow I will be at my house just waiting for your phone call. I'll just be waiting for you.
Enjoying the nature, doing those sorts of things. Just stuff that takes some time, some free time. Right.
So that's just shy of $150,000 a year in passive income from their Airbnb business
Well it looks like we have some spots open tomorrow
And at that income level you would definitely be there
Does that ring a bell at all? It
That's what the company just requires
The 1:00 PM Pacific is available with Mr
And Brian gives us a few minutes to reach out to our students to see how they're doing
Let's do a seven o'clock tonight.
How would that change things for you? Why is that?
Yep. I'm gonna go ahead and email that to you right after this. I've got beck services gmail.com. Is that the best email for you?
For you, freeing up your time and your wife's time is a big driver for you?
Right? Yeah, kinda. I can't remember how I got it. I really can't. <laugh>. Yeah,
Cause like I said, I just stopped so I can Okay
Yeah, dude. You say you working two ask three jobs.
Do you have a hotel where you live?
I, I'd like to get them in locations where people come to visit a lot, like beach locations and things like that
4 3 8 8 5 4 0 0 8 2 1 4 7 9 1 8.
So what's been holding you back so far?
What's happening Donald? That's talked about a blast from the past, man
All righty, sir, have a great weekend.
I know how that goes in the wintertime
Is that their business line or is that your cell phone?
To make it? I just know that you sounded really excited.
I value committing to that time
What do you do right now for work?
Cause I came from Florida and so we have the heat, the humidity, heat
<affirmative>, <affirmative>. Oh yeah, yeah. Wait, so you would work less you think at the hospital? Why's that?
I wanna hook you up with one of our top guys here
I saw you got Brian Page's book and had to start a Airbnb business about three months ago
I'll probably go a little over 2020 K. Okay,
Hey Li, it's Cooper with Bmb Formula from Brian Page's team. How you doing?
And I know it sounds crazy, but we're endorsed by Grant Cardone High
Sometimes you can get in for less
So would an 11:00 AM or 1:00 PM work for you?
So outside of holiday season three bedroom, here's one right here
And so now he's on one of our teams consulting and getting more people involved and it's really pretty cool
Only reason I ask is the video's just super important
What number you don't you have of the last four digits of the number?
No, it's ok. I mean the person I'm just working with is now.
It would just be vital in helping you figure out how to get your first one to two Airbnbs up and running
Cool. And then I've got just jay gmail.com best email for you?
And I mean, just to get some context on where you're at
At this point, Sophia, we've had over 10,000 people purchase the course
I didn't really, really set a goal as far as that, but it's something that would have me comfortable just for the time being
Just based on what we've seen with our students
It varies. I would probably say maybe about 3000.
And the reason why we have that policy in place is just obviously because we wanna protect our executive consultants time
No, I mean, as soon as it gets to my email, I will definitely watch it.
I was like, Well wow, that's great man
I know har on at hard here, just wanted to double check there
Okay, so hear me out on this
So I'm with B and B formula, Brian Page
Wednesday 1230. Man call. Make sure. Yeah, I'm gonna say
And that might be a little off
She's not any leases or any deposits
Yeah, no, I mean, it should be good. Unless something crazy comes up, I should be good at 11:00 AM
I probably can put down at least like 2,500, something like that without hurting my pocket
But I have to schedule everything in
It was like six months later it was like a freeze pause or something
Yeah, yeah, that's a great question man
Well currently that would be 3000, but I have another 6,000 in crypto, but I really like to hold onto that.
I was gonna say I have other sources of income as well.
I don't know, it's a million that just seen you're making a million a years to me just seemed like a big deal
You know, would you be home at that time?
Make a little change and start spending after you make something
Yeah, so I'll put that down for her and make sure that she knows about going the call
Jordan, so if I am gonna do this for you, I'm gonna place you on one of our executive consultant calendar
Well, so far I'm not doing so good cause I got covid.
Oh, there's a place called Bullhead City.
One of their things is they have to put their phones up and focus while they're there
What's that ideal income that you're hoping to get to with an Airbnb business?
I don't, but I'm sure that can change
But Airbnb, we stayed in some when we were in Florida, so this is what, So no, my mindset is this
And then do you go in few weeks at a time you go out to power lines or how does that work?
Now I do have to take a look at their calendars first, but how does all that sound?
Yeah, Saturday I'll be working seven to about six and then after that I wouldn't be of that much use <laugh> I would say
Well Don, I'd love to continue the conversation with you
But with the depths, depths over my head then I won't get approved or anything
So I'm 62, so I'm not gonna be here forever and I'd like to see them really do extremely well
Well Shta actually your student success manager here for Brian
<laugh>. Just go with monthly for now.
So it's totally up to you
Well great credit, that's, that's a stopper for anything in this world
Awesome. And are those both of those or new are new jobs or is this something you've been doing for a while?
So do you mind helping me fill that out real quick? It's just a couple of questions here
I'm I'm all over the place right now
And not that I need a $200,000 a year to scrape by on, but that has been sort of an established lifestyle
So that'd be like seven years from now
I dunno if I'm making sense
Okay. I sure appreciate you calling and letting me know they are some honest people out here
But I was like, Man, I feel like the real estate markets about to boom
Well, I mean, usually people don't buy a book on a business opportunity unless there's a specific result they're looking to get to
Yeah. What is his last name?
Everybody. I wouldn't have to pay for it.
Okay. Okay. And will it come from this phone number then, or?
So you can have an idea of how this is gonna work
So off the top of your head, do you happen to know just a ballpark number of what your credit score is?
Yeah, we don't really want you guys to write a soft yet cause you're probably going what's taking 'em long
Or the different ways that you can run it
So I just wanted to be fully transparent with you and make sure you could make it
Okay. Luckily, Mr. Benno at that time,
I'll see you in three months. I can't do that. <laugh>,
I know money and credit is one and two I know that much but what else is after that?
Okay, so I think I'll make sure I have everything good here in invoice
My husband died a while ago and that was kind of a bummer
At that point, what would you start using the money for
Yeah, it's no what a nonstarter. That's what they would call it. Nonstarter. <affirmative>, it goes nowhere.
I would like to bring my family, of course.
Okay, nice. I once did a spring break in Lake Havasu back when I was in college.
Clause in there that you could lock the landlord in where
What was the question at the end of that sir?
So I was explaining how it works
So apologies for the interesting questions
Yeah, so it just gone through B b refundable call deposit
So what I did was I changed the price a little bit and there's some things I gotta add over there
So we would really would just be looking at the next two days here
So I see we only go to five
No doubt. I appreciate the call.
And then I do a 30, $32,000 salary at the other business
Here we are. What we call these calls sometimes
Was there something that got you excited about the business model? Something you liked about it?
Cabo is one of the best spots I think it just has such good weather and it's safe
Shit and then Yeah, I'm actually looking at a property right now. We've trying to see as we're talking <laugh>.
Stratton, he does ask that they watch video or two before the call
So just a million things have been going on
Do you know your credit score?
Probably even higher than that actually long term
Yeah, it's been a lot of times where I haven't been close to the house and forth the interest in the B formula business.
Okay. What questions do you have about that part specifically?
So we wouldn't have any problems there
Ready to learn, ready to take notes
I said we'll strike two more minutes and then we'll wrap it up here
Yeah. Boom. $10,000 a month extra. Who wouldn't be happy? I know exactly why that number popped into your head.
Beautiful. All right man. Take care.
I gotcha. What are some of the other things you're working on?
I'd be spending more time with them and working on my health
Cool. So Kim, just have some context on you. How much did you invest with Bmb formula?
But I don't know if I would do that
Yeah, you, you'd have to rent, say you rent the house for 2,500, you'd have to get 4,500 in rental income
Okay, I'm just gonna look that up really quick just to confirm because I think Texas might actually have two times in it
But again, you know guys, gimme a fight on me
I really am busy for the next four days straight
That's amazing. Okay, awesome. Well here I just pulled up the schedule. Now are you in central time?
Well, I don't know, it just kind of depends on the situation
Anything. Okay, awesome. Well, would you like me to break down how that call would go if I can find some availability in their calendar?
So I mean for you, what would you do with an extra 20 to $30,000 a month company? I mean, what would change for you personally?
So I don't think I actually read the book, but I do remember buying something for Airbnb
I don't know how much time it would take and I can, yeah, I don't know how much time
And then between all your different sources of income, so you said you're a nuclear engineer or you're in nuclear industry <affirmative>
I mean that's what it is
So that's what this guy does and I'm thinking about getting a job with him
If I can, would tomorrow work for you? Or would Tuesday be better?
Yeah, well I mean Jerry, I'm glad we gotta connect here <laugh>
But we wanna scale fast and we're looking at buying another property to use specifically for Airbnb
I'm gonna make this information that I need.
Has it happened to you before?
Gotcha. And how much would you love to make with Airbnb? Say a year from now?
And basically what I do is onlays liaison between our customer and our engineering team and our manufacturing team
I'm gonna take advantage of this and keep it on hand
Awesome. All right, man, have an awesome day and have an awesome move.
So you kind of have a home base for your house of course
Yeah, for sure man. Well cool. How does it work with taxes and stuff like that? You have all these different properties and stuff or? Yeah,
I'm kicking myself for not getting my first deal done
I mean, they're far more equipped at actually getting new results than I am
Cause basically they can dive deeper into exactly where you're at with everything
And they've all personally done six or even seven figures with their Airbnb business
Well now on a scale of one to 10, you can be totally honest with me
Yes, after 5:00 PM if that's not possible is anybody available on Saturday?
Got a lot of good stuff in there that you would get from the book
I need to be netting that
Yeah, for sure. And just is this the best one for your calendar invite as well?
Is it 1151 for you right now?
How you doing sir? Maybe not that much
Of course, man. Anytime. We'll talk soon. Okay.
I do have a 6:00 AM and a 1:00 PM available tomorrow
So I seen your book on Instagram, I was like, hmm, this is interesting
I appreciate you taking the time and spending time here with me now, and I look forward to hearing how it goes for you
Yeah, we've got folks all over the place
I'll send you over a 12 minute video
What did your life look like man?
You wanted as a second income
Appropriate, say about 10 hours a
Okay. And final thing how much capital do you have available to put into deposits for properties when you're getting leases?
If you don't want to answer, that's alright
So we're gonna put you with him at 1230 on Wednesday
Yeah, for sure, man, go ahead.
We can honestly probably cover more in five minutes on the phone than in the entirety of the whole book
So I'm in the oil and gas business and it's just driving me nuts
So puts a smile on my face
And do you intend on showing up with the call?
How do you feel that having an eight
So that would be my goal, but I think it's just gonna be a natural progression to that
We have full time executive consultants who are light years ahead of me, far more equipped at actually getting you results than I am
Like I said, I'm all over the place right now
Most people, they don't have the courage to think that big
<laugh>. There we go, man. That's all I'm asking for. That's all I'm asking.
And so that's really what I do
I'll go ahead and email that to you after this
I'm sorry. One second. Christopher dot
I realized that working a job was never gonna get me anywhere
Yeah, seeing how you can get a, get some more folks on
Yes, but I will lower my prices and I mean, I will continue to lower them
And the mortgage should be done in December
And you are in the adopt
So do you guys provide list of owners, find these owners that are open to doing this?
Jackson, he's gonna figure out what's best for you
Well that is all the information that our executive consultant needs to figure out what's best for you
I'm new to it so I haven't really thought about that right now
No, not unfortunately. Not at this time, no.
And I've done it for a long time before owning my own
And so finding a handyman, it sounds like that was a challenge for you
I mean you can always work on something, you can always put the time in even if you don't have the money
Do you have an email that you're gonna send me? You send me the email
Okay. Yeah, for sure. Who wouldn't want an extra three grand a month?
Okay. Is there a particular number that I like an area code that I'm supposed to look for?
I mean they twin 70 year old boys and they need their dad here
Brian wants me to check in on you guys, see if there's any way we can help you, that's curious for you
Get to know these four grandkids that I, I've never really met <laugh>.
Oh, I can probably do probably let's say like 10 to 15 gram. Okay,
Okay, let's do the 6:00 AM pacific time,
And you wouldn't necessarily have to go outside of your state or your city either for that matter
So it sounds like this is actually pretty important
Okay. Do you know the limits on those
So for starters, I'd like to get something passive
I believe I have a five 30 here
So I'm definitely willing and of the call and I will be ready at three
For now? I stretch myself self so sense
There's literally not a doubt in my mind that you commit yourself to this, you will succeed
Typically there's a little bit of a barrier there, but the calendar's just cut off and can't do that
All right. Of course. No problem. You have a great, great day.
So yeah, that's where I'm at
Okay. And how much are you making now per month?
And the reason why we have that policy in place is obviously we wanna protect our executive consultants time and yours as well
All right, and then the only other thing before the call is Mr
I've got a couple times on Monday and a couple times on Tuesday
Well, looks like you are locked in with Ms
The shifts really aren't as much tactical as they are mental
So is there any reason at all why you wouldn't be able to make it?
I just, I've been real busy now to had time to sit down and put nothing together.
Okay, sweet. Awesome. Can I ask if,
Cause I haven't looked at it in a month so I can just actually look at it right now
We're doing this big push right now to increase our average results of anyone that purchased something from us
So like I said earlier, I can hook you up with someone if it makes sense
I would a thousand percent say just the allocation of time
That's not what I take care of here
I'd be working on artistic projects of my own just creating infrastructure and programs to help my community
I think anything after 4:00 PM so I think 5:00 PM would work if not, it may have to be after six
Thanks man. I appreciate you. And what's the name? I forgot your name at the beginning there.
So we would just wanna make sure that you can reciprocate that for the full 60 minutes
Wow. You are working seven, six days a week too.
I really don't wanna do it anymore. <laugh>.
And you even doing it and you run into challenges, but you've even put in the work so far
You got another guy who started 12 months ago, he's got 14 properties now and he is gonna net 25 grand this month
Hey Daniel, it's Cooper, it's BNB Formula. Brian Page's team. How you doing?
I could guess, but that's about it.
So we're actually allowed to hook you up with some free resources and materials that can help you out get farther down the road
Worst, worst case scenario, she would just get me in the car so we can talk and drive
Only for two for their first property.
You want me to break down how that call would go if I can find some availability in their calendar?
No, not at this time. I don't, I'm not sure.
<laugh>, I think that's when I stopped getting into it
All right, sounds good. Saturday <laugh>. No worries. It's kind of cute. I kind like it
Okay. All right, go ahead. Are you there, Drew? Okay. All right. So are you
It'll bring you up to speed
You're good to go for Mr
Does that kind of answer your question?
So I try to buy rental properties and to have, at least that's my retirement right there is houses
Everybody says we get these courses and we never follow through
So we do have some money set aside for it
Great. And just before we wrap,
So I don't know how much I can commit it for
But if I can do that with b and b, I'm definitely comfortable just doing that
So I don't know, it just comes from being the oldest kid, I guess
Man, I've been traveling, working, so I haven't really had anything any time to do anything,
I mean I might have things
Well do you have a regular
And it sounds like you only have a few minutes, so we'll wrap this up here
And I will get that book shipped out to you, the 9 99 book and the software
<laugh>? Right now I'm working on it cuz we were moving to Florida
So for you, no, what's kind of that monthly income that would be ideal from doing an Airbnb business
But first I would want to make sure I'm doing my due diligence and providing you as much value
It kind of makes sense, I just wanna make sure I understand it
If you recall, you got Brian's book a few weeks ago and had to create financial independence with Airbnbs
All right. <laugh> willing to show up to the call focus with no distractions, ready to take some notes?
I'm gonna be coming home just so I can get to that call at 1230
And so some people, they already own their own properties like you do, and so you can do it that way
I'm the dude who's like, I'm believing in you and whatever it takes, we're gonna make it happen and whatever it takes
And of course I'll take down some notes for her and you guys will probably go pretty deep into that on the call <affirmative>
For sure. What email do you have of mine?
But I wanted to know pretty much what's the pitfall versus the income versus how long it's going to take to get the first
Oh cause I mean that's what we do everything for
Yeah, let me refresh here and see. So it looks like the furthest I have out is actually Thursday.
Hey man, I'm doing good. How you doing?
I can email that to you right after this
So I got three, about three houses that are on borderline of almost getting kicked off of Airbnb
Morning. I've got 10:00 AM on Wednesday morning.
If I get a property, if I get a property, I'm more than likely use my credit card to get things done
So it sounds like your kids are a pretty big motivation for this
It's a good mentality to have
I mean we've created hundreds of multi six figure airbnbers and dozens of seven figure airbnbers at this point
I have a dog, all that stuff, the kids, but I can get em to put to aside <laugh>
And you haven't gotten anyone to pay out
I love, I love that. I love it. I love it.
Cooper. Cooper. Awesome. Nice to meet you Cooper. Appreciate it.
Again, no, we're excited about, I mean we're closer to retirement
It's just all about timing right now
We gotta connect here and I think I may have a super solid idea of how we can help you
Oh sorry. Yeah, my microphone's been a little bit weird today. So I asked you truck driving, are you driving cross country? What's that?
Yeah. Where's he based out of?
No worries. Okay. Morning or afternoon? Better
I value making the commitment to that
Oh, hey, good. How are you?
Actually, I'm gonna send over that ebook to you
A lot of people either didn't make it all the way through or it's been a while, so no worries there
An average property net's $2,000 per month
I understand that people's been through things that are harder than what I've been through in my life, but it doesn't change that
So the last thing I'm required to do, so Mr
We had to go into debt to get it started
Yeah. Would you wanna quit your job at that level
One? If I had to guess one? Somewhere between 1 35, 1 40.
Now, obviously if that's the case, well then, yeah, of course that does require higher level investment, does cost money
And that's just going to landlords, securing a lease from them, furnishing the property, staging it, and then putting it on Airbnb
I don't know. Let's say about five, $10,000.
I will be there. Sounds good. Are you gonna send me an email?
I mean, just to give you some context, we have a guy on our team who does, he's gonna do 1
I know you're driving right now, but I'm, I'm gonna send over a calendar invite to your email, Luke Roche 1212 gmail
And then Dwayne, before I hop off here is the Dwayne Foster
No, it'd have to be Monday or Tuesday of next week
As far as I know, I've accepted it's on the schedule.
Where would you guys travel to?
I mean, as many as possible. Anybody or anybody that wants to learn whoever, no feeling to that. There's no ceiling to that
I got maybe I i'll but I it's, It's me right now
So is there any reason at all we wouldn't be able to make it today?
I have a goal to buy and either flip or buy and partial out 10 real estate notes through notes school
<laugh>, you see it'd be a big advantage to basically get all the kinks worked out, figure all that stuff out
You know what I'm saying? I don't want to do this all my life
Day. Have an awesome day. You too.
Awesome. Well cool man. Chris, what time zone are you in
And here's what I can do in the meantime
We've had people who are able to do it faster than that, but just depends on, everybody's situation is a little bit different
Now I'm trying to get back into my business
Instead of Airbnb? I would buy, just buy properties and rent them out.
Hey Mary, it's Thomas with b B Formula from Brian Page's team. How are you?
Okay, awesome. Would you like me to break down how that call would go if I can find some availability in their calendar?
And that's all I gotta say
They never got started with Airbnb, but that's really just cuz they didn't do anything, They didn't take any action
And then when I go home I get the five kids were running and doing stuff
That's actually why I'm reaching out today
No, you're good man. Keep going.
I know that can be an issue sometimes and I totally get that
Oh yeah, I see brother's talked about that as we talked to him about Airbnb
And they usually do that by getting about two new properties and then cutting the workload down to 10 hours a week from Airbnb
I would like to continue to expand my Airbnb business but I'm just not gonna send money
I guess that number you said in the beginning about how much would I need, I haven't figured that out
He probably also run through a lot of mistakes, things like that, that people make when they first get that first property
Oh, okay. Yeah, I live in Seattle. That's where I'm headed.
I, I just did the numbers and I was freaking out about it
20 k a year or something like that.
I, I'll send you over my cell phone number, man
Well, it's like the ideal monthly income you're hoping to get to with Airbnb
So at a minimum I owe four extra years out of that time they said I owed
What do you think is a good time? We can talk, Yeah, yeah
I gotta tell you one more thing
I myself, I would give myself 10 years to think focus and being very intentional with my time every single day
Oh okay. Close to 70,000. Gotcha. And then as of now, I mean how much available? How much liquid? Oh yeah,
It you guys, a lot of time call today
Pacific. All right. Do you wanna pull up your schedule for tomorrow and just take a look at what you got going on?
If it's not coming through, I know, I can see if I can get this manually confirmed in my side here
Just thank you for, sounds like you've been very willing and patient with the process
And why the new car? Why is that one of the first things you would do? Oh
Yeah, that's what that's talking about.
A hundred percent. And so many. What time zone are you in?
It would need to be on lunch break if it's gonna be that long. Yeah, it it'd need to be on lunch or after hours.
Makes them a minimum of 1500 bucks a month in profit
Cause you weren't a, it wasn't, wasn't as intense
How much do you guys have available that you could put into properties over the next one to three months with Airbnbs
If there's anything else like information, you could just email me
So that's mainly where I totally I don't need much to live
<affirmative>. Gotcha. Yeah, that's definitely So
Would you mind helping me fill that out really quick? Just a few questions
They charge a thousand dollars for their consulting session, but Brian has given me the green light for certain people
So I'm excited to see them help you clear that up
All right, sounds good. Victor, thank you very much how it goes for you.
On some more stuff. I moved from Washington to Arizona, so
I've gotten 1130 to 1230 slot.
Cause I'm trying to flip this property cause I'm gonna buy me a tractor
Give me a second. Joe Saber or the bar? Yes,
That'd be good ideally. Okay, awesome. So you would retire your wife in, Would you stop working as well at that rate?
All right. I've got C do Shavan Source investing us. Is that the best email for you?
Oh, okay, cool. Are we at, you're like Virginia Beach area or more central
I have a solid understanding of it
Do you have your own property yet?
So with that said are you excited to take advantage of some time with a consultant?
Thanks. Sorry, I'm, I'm just multitasking here. And
Okay. Okay, gotcha. And I'm not sure what's good with our system, but what's your first and last name?
And he is doing all the rental arbitrage
Usually we use a third party hand processor
So on our team, we have full-time executive consultants who are light years ahead of me
She could have refinanced <affirmative>, but if she had just kept her name, it would've been different
And I know I'm <laugh> harping on it hard here
We'd get about one new property every 45 days, and the average property nets between 1500 and $2,000 a month
It's a lot of people who really don't believe in me as far as well myself like this
Do you know your credit score right now?
No, no I don't have a lot liquid available right now
I'm gonna email that to you right now
My name's Thomas I work with him
No charge unless you just blatantly nohow or whatever
Definitely would be that move and more family vacation with my kids. With my kids. <laugh>. <laugh>,
Yeah. Well, I have a few ideas of how we can help you. Are you curious?
Nah, I'm driving from San Diego to Seattle. Oh
It's hard to be year round
Okay. And do you have about 45 minutes available at 5:00 PM to hop on the call and get the information you need?
I Perfect. Yeah, we'll give you a heads up just in case
But as far as the Airbnb goes what do you guys do? What is your job? I guess you could say that
That's charging you a high ticket price to make them more money and then you are not even guaranteed
So primarily I moved here to have more opportunities so I take any opportunity I can get
It's k a t h e r i n e.
I definitely wouldn't stop if I <laugh> some people, just some people I'm good, you want, but
All right. I'm waiting for it. Perfect. I got my email open. I'm waiting for it. Thank you.
A group chat with us as well. Sounds okay. That sounds like a good point. Okay. <affirmative>. Awesome. Thank you. I appreciate that.
Yeah, I, I'm sure. I just don't recall right now. Sorry.
No, thank you. I think you pretty much got all summed up.
I just, I don't wanna deplete all my savings, so I wanna be conservative
Okay. You want me to break down how that call would go if I can find some availability in the calendar?
So that's kind of why I'm at with my life
So Kim, that's obviously a huge vision, which is amazing
And there's one last thing Mr
I talked to him about Airbnb cause he is wife, no kids yet, but probably pretty soon, the next few years
And are you on duty pretty often? Are you working pretty long hours?
Nothing that the folks we've been talking to have been held back, held up too much at least
So he started in February of last year
All right, thanks man. What's your name again?
I think I can actually look up my account number on my computer
We are approaching the end of the bull run
Well I'll tell you what a set for you and Mr
So they work directly with Brian Page himself and they're regularly charging about a thousand bucks just for a single hour of consulting
So one last thing I'm required to do is just fill out a little form so that Mr
After 60 minutes? I have to put it in
So let me ask you a question
I don't wanna be coming into something
Oh yeah, absolutely. I mean, yeah, absolutely.
And I wanna give back to as many people as help as many people as I can
Are you able to watch that before you speak with him on Wednesday morning?
What I'll do here, here, I'll just do that right now while we're still on the phone here
Okay. What about the other two? Do you know the, what's available on the other two?
Really be probably the course not, doesn't take that long
We're just gonna put this in here after you watch the video
It's a hundred dollars cancellation fee.
I would get a house for every single person in the world. I mean everybody deserves some kind of a boat. A boat, don't you think?
You might hear me typing here for a second
Just want my time to have your time back to not have to do time's
Yeah, I'm about a 7 25 to seven 30.
I'll probably shoot you a reminder on Wednesday or something like that just to remind you of the Thursday call
Yeah. So listed over the phone, we have a payment processor reuse.
So I'm pulling up one of our consultants, Mr
Heck man, you're, you're making 50 K a month from it. Gotta
All right, man. Enjoy your conference and have a great rest of your week. We'll talk to you soon.
That I can make money off of it
They won't pull your credit or anything like that
So sos that you So it's the job right now. So is why is that?
Okay, gotcha. So you would actually if you could just replace your income, you would just completely transition, you'd quit your current job?
So just to be fully transparent with you, we actually do not book these executive consultations where we waive the fee for you
So of course I'm open to hear how and what that looks like
Got a couple friends who thinking about joining it with me
So with that being said, please disturb, do whatever you need to do to remind yourself them on the call up
Well the reason I'm calling and don't worry, I'm not here to try to sell you anything
Gotcha. Is that so that you could have some more free time or you just don't like your job? Or why that?
I'll reach out to Diane after this call and then let Mr
Yes. Hold on, gimme a second.
But I mean I always answer my phone so
You got to get this here, you got to get that technical part and that that's where you get stuck at
But the few people that did really had incredible success
Fucking wait till summer next to you, dude. <laugh>, you better keep that same energy cause it fucking sucks.
Which one of those would work better for you?
Okay, cool. You want me to break down how that call would go if I can find some availability in their calendar
That sound cool? That sound cool. I have to get my questions together though. I ready to kick it on that right now
Mean if you just had extra coming in after expenses I guess it's like, well what do you spend your money on?
So I've been doing pretty well there
Sure thing. Are you in the program too, Thomas?
So this, I've been just kind of spending some time there and trying to expand my connections and relationships
Hey Eric. Good to hear from you man. We got disconnected last night, but I'm glad we get connected again this morning.
Now it's just a matter of figuring out how can we make that possible for you
And I mean, it would just feel really good for you to be able to provide that and get everyone together
What else? I mean that's a lot of extra money coming in
I'd have plus have a house of my own at that point being taken care of by the Airbnb and not have to stress
And so it looks like we got you confirmed and booked in with Mr
You don't have control of your own life if you're out working for somebody 25 days a week or whatever it is,
Awesome. And then right now you said you do tool, what would you say you do for a living right now?
It's it, I guess you could say yes and no
Hey John, it's Thomas with b B Formula from Brian Pages team. How you doing?
Hey Andrew. This is Cooper with BNB Formula. Brian Page's team. How you doing?
Only reason I ask that is just like video, super important
The place where you can take your family on trips and really have the freedom to do what you really want
And what would you do if you didn't have to work? What do you think you would spend your time and money doing?
Move Florida? Not yet. Probably nine months outta the year.
Gotcha. Then what do you do for work? Right now
That's what it's gonna boil down to
If not, we'll just keep it at five
I'll I'll shoot you a reminder as well next week
I dunno if she's still working tonight
Would that be an issue on Friday or? I also have a seven o'clock central on Friday
Yeah. Cause our average property, our average property makes $2,000 per month. Awful.
I mean, I appreciate you actually because I know you probably filter calls all the time
Yes well I'm stuck because I trying to figure out how to get the next property.
Okay let's do 9:00 AM and that's central standard, right?
We gonna try to got new drugs now, new treatments to stop people from being hospitalized
Rub Smith in a group chat, the call, and then you can send me a text on that one
Well I'll send that over to you right after this call
Awesome. So Lia, what time zone are you in?
So Katrice, just a few more things before wrap it up here
I'd like to be making over 10. 10,000. Okay.
Yeah, I got a five 30 on Friday.
Yeah, of course, man. Of course.
And also, just one last important thing
Great talking as well. Thank you.
If not, I think my next day off isn't until May
I mean it's just a gorgeous house
So honestly man, these questions would probably be much better fielded for one of our executive consultants
All right. So do you know what your credit score's at Wally?
You have about five minutes. You about 45 minutes time gonna
Sounds real good to be honest.
<affirmative>? Yeah, on the Baja California serve that strip, right. There's
No, because she picks up my son at two 30. If you want both of us, it'll probably be like three if that's better.
My wife is still with that person in the dining room and I came downstairs to my office.
Yeah, she led me. I do <laugh>.
Hey Stefano, it's Cooper over at Brian Page's team. How you doing?
So John, is that something you'd be opposed to taking advantage of Jeff?
Is there a link, you should see a link in there to add a calendar.
So I had to make it out on my own
You're the smartest guy in the entire world
For you, what would you do as 10 to $15,000 extra coming in?
If we could schedule it, that'd be fine.
I don't have any connection to Airbnb anymore. I paid for it and everything disappeared,
Well, the reason I'm calling you is I'm the manager of our student success team
Well, I mean, we've had a lot of people, dozens of students who have hit $20,000 a month within their first six months
And it's a real simple, blunt conversation
So is that a time that you can 100% commit to being able to make
And growing up on food stamps and mom on welfare or child support, my mom never worked
So I work with the fire department here
It was just my fault for not kicking in
Well brand, I'll let you get going
But if it needs to be done by somebody else or whatever, I could do the 11
But I haven't really made that jump because I guess I'm scared <laugh>
Okay, awesome. Would you like me to break down how that call would go if I can find some availability in their calendar?
Okay. Let me see here. Would you be able to, on Monday or Tuesday, would you be able to make a five 30
Thomas. Thank you so much, Thomas.
Awesome. So you're at about 6 21 credit score and 42,000 gross?
So I mean now that's done affecting the Airbnb business
Well Jerry, first off I gotta say I love your energy
But just a partial stepping stone
So I wouldn't want to step on any toes there
What time zone are you in right now?
What about being your own boss is important to you?
I kind of take off on Friday and then I start cleaning on Saturday
I guess freedom, financial freedom.
There you go. You're the boat at Lake Havasu. Right on. Anything else I have you take care of or anything?
So it's just talking to him
Some people go and they own them
I'd be able to get four five, I can do six credit a month
I mean I have a full blown estate company as a result of it
I'm just trying to get an idea of who you are just to see if there's a way that I could help out
You got his book about two months ago. Book about a few
That's not, yeah, because as I said, I actually live in a good era for this
Oh gosh, it just <laugh>, that makes life easier for sure. <laugh>.
But that wasn't working for us because we were fairly new at the time and it was hard for us to build that trust
As well? End would be max? No, it was not.
It would all depends on how good it go
So for you, in a perfect world, it's kind of the ideal monthly income that you're hoping to get to with Airbnb? Yes
Yeah, I just wanna see if it's good for me
So I'll probably have better gonna have numbers for sure
Yeah, so it looks like we got disconnected last night
You said extra income earlier and that you wanted to turn your townhouse into an Airbnb
I've watched my parents do that and stuff and I don't know, there's more to life than work
I like an island D like in Delta, E like in Echo
And so it sounds like you want to get to 20, $30,000 a month
Yeah, that does sound like a long time
Okay. What would it take to get you off the tugboat thousand bucks a month? 4,000?
I don't like working for anyone else
We hit it good to retire are you good there? Are you gonna be like, that's enough or would you keep it going?
Right now I'm a hundred percent focused on my active income
It seems like that's all
Well, as far as long Go ahead.
But when we're talking about traveling, I'd like to see places we like to go to
Well I mean yeah, 15 net would be cool.
You're probably getting to a punchline here at some point
<silence> Okay. And then what's the middle initial on that card?
Obviously cuz you've got control of your own life
So maybe would you try to create a life
Yeah, I'd certainly be open to it.
So we put a lot of energy and effort into it and a lot of amenities are gonna be there
So I mean, at this point, don't worry about not getting started
If it makes sense, I'm all for it
So what do you think there?
Definitely, I think that would be lovely. Think that'd be awesome.
Some people were like gonna, other people were
But anyway, I'm glad you guys are now it's funny, I was just thinking about it
Not clear. Yeah. Do you feel like you have a hundred percent clarity?
I think, I'm sorry, I worked all night. I'm just laying here thinking about how much my life sucks.
Yeah, I'm gonna send you, I'm gonna put you with our top executive consult
So can you commit to watching that before your call tomorrow? Sure
Yeah. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. What's the other openings do they get
Cause I am going to write, if this works out, I am going to write one
We're gonna put you with Matt Renzi
So what about that lifestyle draws it you to it?
And I understand, and I understand you've also gotten burned in the past very recently because of the damn market
So I'm all about leverage man
I gotta take a look at the calendar first, but how's that sound?
And now of course the second thing to look at when you're going to get leases is basically debt to income ratio
Do you want me to share it?
You're welcome. Have a nice night man.
So for the general generational of wealth, you're talking about him about's
I mean it's completely full days and Thursday I'm flying out early Thursday and I think I get back to Charlotte like about noon
Okay, well I'll tell you what man
Yeah, I'll be able to watch it. Sounds good.
So how much is your guys program? What's the name of the program again? Cause I contacted a lot of people, I'm sorry
I just kind of wanted to see what the model was
She feels, feels I've been played, but it's not that I've been played, it's just I wasn't effective on following the instructions, I guess.
Dude, I, I'm excited for this call for you and excited to see where you go after this
No, it's definitely happened. It's definitely happened to some,
And then also, like I said, work, I mean, yeah,
So right now I'm spending money so I can profit off that money I'm spending
Meaning that if I don't find a way to increase my income, then it's just a dream at that point and it's a useless dream
So is there any time that you have, or would it absolutely have to be next week?
So I have an idea of how I can help you
I see calendar outlook events today, but I don't know if you add to what you call the guy get started,
So I, in a perfect world, if I could have three hours a day to focus on a business, then I'd be successful
Oh no. Yeah, if that started coming in, I'd definitely pursue it further.
I have a Apple card with a five thousand five thousand four hundred twenty two limit
But just a bunch of places I wanna see
Does I mean that ever create some uncertainty for you? Cause it sounds like security is really, really important
And so it's kind of cool that you guys are doing this
I'm just gonna break down kind of Holly Kohl's work and then we can get you locked in for the calendar spot
I purchased this training so long ago and I should have had at least a couple deals in already
Well, so if you, I know Daniel because you're, Yeah,
So what's that been like for you having to support them with what you have available?
Okay. I mean either way, as long as it's someone who works for the company, I'm pretty sure have the same values. I understand how it
So you'd be on that list there
Actually, one last thing before your call, Mr
So I, Yeah, just moan, just trying to back it up
Okay. Yeah. Okay. I'll send it to both then I'll use the email at price 99 Yahoo to send that one over.
They work directly with Brian Page himself, and they regularly get paid like a thousand bucks an hour for their consulting
That's 72, 72 hours plus my other job, I work anywhere from, I don't know, 50, around 50 hours a week
Is that all <laugh> that cash or
So w2, then I think on W2 I'm only like 40,000 but in all cuz I do take draws cuz I'm a business owner
No for where I want to be
But yeah, I mean definitely my to-do list the next few weeks
If you have a business, If you have a business, they look at two years
All right, well then let's do it
I wanna spend my time to another thing, <affirmative>
Nope. Okay. Nope, you're totally good as is. Don't worry about it.
Sure. I'm sorry, I forgot, what was your name again? Cooper. Cooper. Have you been doing the Airbnb Vancouver?
And then obviously something else they look at when you're getting loses is your annual income
And tara airbnb gmail.com, is that the best email for you?
I wouldn't really call it deployment, but I am here doing things around the border and it just put everything on hold
Life is about choices and the more income that you have, the more level of freedom that you have there
Currently, what are you making per month?
Okay, cool. That sounds good. Yeah, and me I'm thinking about giving you a different email address. Can I do that?
So Cody, I just wanna make sure I kind of got a context on where you are
And some of our coaches at a much higher and ongoing level
Well, cause I could get more get outta this
Oh yeah, yeah. All right. Well I'm interested.
And you can just watch that basically
So Chad, I'm super excited to see our conversation goes
So in a perfect world, no boundaries
That's a lot of time to do other things
You should see a link top to press accept invitation
What's a long term? Long term passive income.
But I know I leave probably Jamaica
And then his last name's Ben Wa kinda like it
I'll just be paying somebody to come in and clean up
We have a sister company that we've created that actually does this business model on a very large scale
Yeah. That's awesome. So would go back to Paris first or you go somewhere else?
I'm doing fine. How are you?
Yeah, it's the BA right now
And then see you guys some context and then give Ms
What's that? Let's do one 30 actually. One 30 works.
In an ideal world, yes. Maybe 10. Okay. Ish at the bonus for her.
Jackson has all the context that he needs
And then top right press plus. And then if you set your alarm to go for about 4:50 PM today and then just press save.
Yeah, hang on one second. Okay, hang on, Cooper.
Are you the same guy that contact me? I think it was a few weeks ago.
We really do wanna make a move to long term, maybe make this a career
And you make the revenue from Airbnb
So basically people not shown for their appointments, which I a hundred percent You sound like someone of integrity, your person of their word
This guy's middle of the road
And what would you do if you had unlimited free time
I'm now able to buy a property, but there isn't much on the market that is affordable here where I live
Thanks, I appreciate this follow up call.
Only because it's a digit shy from seven <laugh>.
It actually did back in the day man, I was doing P 90 x Pix three Insanity and all of those
See here we could do a 10:00 AM Eastern, an 11:00 AM Eastern. Would either of those work for you initially?
Yeah, I'm really just looking for freedom and financial
So, okay, this gave me a message that your cards, security code's incorrect
I know, I'm sorry, go ahead.
It's been a while now, to be honest I would say.
I love energy that surrounds that type of vibe
Yeah, no, that makes total sense
He just basically it's all paycheck to paycheck stuff cause it's like you're not working, you're not getting paid
So the last thing I'm required to do is just fill a little form just so that Mr
Ask another question if he not will not to be available, but I, am I going charge me?
I'll see what I can do
And Jonathan, a hundred dollars compared to their normal 1000, that's a huge range
<laugh>. No, we will let you, You know,
It's there to retire. That's about it. It's there to grow it until and then quit my nine to five.
And I think that should be just about everything Mr
Yeah, that's really what it's about for me
I mean it's pitfalls in this
I'm not really the expert in the Airbnb side of things
And so that has become more just dominating my time
But for you specifically, why financial freedom? Why is that important to you?
Well, do you wanna do me a favor and pull up your schedule for tomorrow and just take at what youve got going on?
They're far more equipped at actually getting new results than I am
That's perfect. <affirmative>, I can do that.
You watch that before you call
Yeah, so I mean I have an engineering degree from Merriman College and also have some sales experience
Sure, yeah. What do you want
And where are you guys at now? Far as as passive income per month?
Okay. That's the gross number. Is that self-employment income?
Specifically that replace my work income.
You're gonna lose some money, everything is gonna go easy
Which one of that is it more for you?
So what we can do instead is I can just send you an invoice for PayPal, that way I don't have your information
Yep, you're good? A hundred percent. Okay, cool Mr. Ren.
My main goal is really just to help support my family and the people around me that I love the most
Yeah. Gotcha. And so do you think right now with what you're doing that you're gonna be able to have success with Airbnbs anytime soon?
Let see. No, I don't know why it's not.
Some people come in, they have success fast than others based on maybe they had more experience in real estate whatnot
I'm not saying that at all
Well see. What time zone will you be in tomorrow? <laugh>? Probably a better question.
So they regularly charge about a thousand bucks just for a single 60 minute consulting session
And so I send it through PayPal and then what if you don't refund it,
<laugh>, hold on. <laugh> <laugh>, Okay,
And then just one last thing
Right. Okay. Do I need to make a call with somebody or is somebody gonna call me?
And then just so that he's fully aware
No. No. I mean yes, but I work for myself so now
And at the time of the Okay, cool
I'm doing fantastic my man. How are you doing? Did you get the pipe figured out?
But also I'm a commission based worker as well
And I'm gonna go ahead and send over a calendar invite to your email
I think they're all sitting at 10,000.
So it's kind of a little selfish thing while we also are unselfishly helping others
So two, try four, life at Gmail
Should I feel like, should I still read the book and try to execute on it? Or just leave it all? I mean,
I don't know. I haven't what the income of an Airbnb brings in, so I couldn't tell you <laugh>.
And then again, that will be refunded when you show up to the call on Friday
So. Yeah. Well, I appreciate that and I didn't mean to cut you off there.
Is that still a time that is free for you?
So we stayed in a Airbnb in South Carolina we had a great experience
I've, I've never heard of that position
Now I would need to check a take look at their calendars and see if that would work, but how does that sound?
I come, like I said, I come home today
Yes, it does. Awesome. And I'm still using, using the course <laugh>.
Okay. And what is your current gross annual income, the number you'd be putting on your tax returns? Last year?
He's been doing this a while, so he's gonna be able to help you out, get you some good information there
But one thing I've been struggling with is the lock
And if I could probably go get it tomorrow, I probably would
Smith, his time is being respected as well
You're left with $2,000 after that
I can shuffle some things around
As far as with my own or with getting any of you? Airbnbs
It takes the time to email that to you
Great Falls. Now is that near? Oh no. Look, I gotta, Were you in Washington? Were you in Spokane back in the day? Yep.
So I wanted to see how you're doing man
Well definitely have more time to be at focus on the family at home without having to pull a shift every day and whatnot
You kind of treat it like a hotel and then host it there
Would you be able to for sure, go through that, maybe take some notes?
Yeah, I wanna make sure I don't get something that's IY down
Do you want me to share it?
Okay. Well first off, was there anything in particular that kind of held you back from getting started in Airbnb?
Awesome. Chad, what time zone are you in?
So I was different to looking that side
I haven't. Okay. Has there been anything specifically you've been struggling with or still need to figure out?
Yeah, I think usually month end sometimes is security deposit as well.
Let me get it, put you in my notes
Like to more ideally at 20 or $30,000 a month
Yeah, that would be the idea behind it is to find more passive ways to make money as opposed to what I currently do
So we're, we're covering the $2,000 a month mortgage and enough to pay all the internet bills and the water bills and everything
Yes, it's, It's been a while.
So that's what I'm gonna get into here pretty soon
I add to Google calendar I had
So I'll go ahead and get your finalized in for that time with Mr
So I, it would definitely be a focal point I guess if the one we find success
Well, I'm currently working on my real estate license, so I mean, I'm open for an opportunity
<laugh>? Yeah. That was cool. No, I remember that.
And it sounds like, it sounds like it
I've been doing a lot of research into real estate and stuff and it just peaked my interest
Yeah, probably about 1 75 would take care of everything
Fair enough. I've got a 10 or 11:00 AM
It just dropped man, only because my debt income ratio had went up
Well Greg, it looks like we are locked in
Oh definitely. Yeah. We don't have any grandkids.
Gotcha. And between the two, how much are you cash on off those?
So the first thing to look at when you're gonna get a lease is your credit score, obviously
Cause maybe I'm just paranoid, but I just don't see the course we're on as the world going to trade
Do you have a meeting or a call during that time or would that be able to work?
Can I set the what
All right, Christine, appreciate the time. I'm super glad we got to connect and looking forward to hear how it goes for you.
Yeah, for sure. Would that I would that mean for you to be able to cut your hours drastically from what you're doing now?
So are you in Eastern time zone or mountain time zone?
It is what it is, but
Okay. Is there anything in particular that's held you back from transitioning before?
Okay, cool. Want me to break down quickly how that would go if I can find some availability this week?
I was asking you how much income do you need to be bringing each month to be able to replace your full-time income?
So I love that you said that growing business up more than it is now
Okay? Sounds great. Thank you so much.
Well, about 4,000 a month for taxes.
Yes. Who am I? Speak? Hey
Sterling, that is, that's admirable man
I don't have any kind of retirement plan whatsoever
And so, I mean it's real really difficult
And if you're gonna make that happen, I'll be happy
Absolutely. If you could send that right away. Yep,
It's definitely in the seven hundreds and not for sure.
I mean, we've seriously been able to help hundreds of people create multiple six figure incomes
Why don't we do this, I'm gonna wa the a hundred dollars fee for no shows and reschedules
Well, the reason I'm calling is I'm the manager on our student success team here for Brian
And it really just depends on the type of properties
That's actually why I'm reaching out just to help people out
And I'd like to get those up and running, have a property management team to help me with that
Whether you need new ones, she might have to send those to you as well
And a lot of people will just put in an offer to the landlord and say, Hey, I wanna buy this <affirmative>
Hotel industries a lot different, but a lot more people started going to Airbnbs actually during Covid and afterwards <affirmative>
We can do it real quick over the phone
I don't have time to really go in there and tell 'em, well, I didn't receive it, this and that
It hasn't been downloaded from the server yet, so maybe where I'm located too
Your photos, your headlines how you write
Okay. So this is important then really important. And not only to do it but to do it soon.
Not particularly. I'm more doubted on the Airbnb space, but you can go ahead anyways. Well
Well now we had a guy that started 12 13 months ago now actually
Perfect, Jack. Well I'll go ahead and get this locked in for you and send you over an invite.
Cool. I will make it happen for you. Okay, we'll let you go. And
I didn't do anything and I
And I don't know if social security is gonna be there, so I always try to do something else
It was a long This is actually not something that we've been doing for very long
Yeah, there's still a lot you could do with that.
Is it gonna be a video call or a Zoom
Just having time more to enjoy life
So maybe we can work something out and I will definitely arrange something within 24 hours, 48 hours
Basically all always on my folder that time
Be like, well I don't have capital to do it
And again his wife was doing the cleaning, it was a bad experience for her <affirmative> and then things like that, <affirmative>
And I mean, as I'm sure you probably understood with Covid, the whole hospitality industry has totally shifted
And so at the moment it cost me nothing
What would that allow you to do
Okay, so do you wanna pull up, Oh wait, lemme see
And you're familiar with Eddie Speed, I'm sure
What would you do with some of the extra money that you had coming in
We're doing this big push to increase our average student results
Glad to hear it. I'm doing fantastic, my man. Do you remember purchasing Brian's book a while back starting an Airbnb business?
Does any of that sound like it would be beneficial to you?
My job is to check in with our students, see how they're doing
All of that stuff. I don't, Yeah, I don't know about all that yet.
Okay. Yeah absolutely. I definitely, I'm, I think we would definitely benefit from,
I think it's gonna take about five years just to get everything in place
I, I haven't really gone to implement it yet
So last thing I'm required to do is just fill out a little form just so that Mr
Yeah, come on the security questions. Save, save. It should be on there now.
Oh, I was just asking if you could help me fill out this form really quick. It's just two or three questions.
I picked up the book in case you were gonna reference it so I have it here
Oh man, I don't remember that.
Yeah, I doubt man. We should be there.
That's that. And that would be perfect for life right there.
I mean due to our quality of life, man, I want that peace of mind, dude
So it's pretty insane if you just think about a $1,200, an average one bedroom in the US is about $1,200 for rent
No, no, I, I'm the one that, not now
When I check last, actually I can check it in just a second
But that I was going with what Airbnb and I looked at the comparable ones around here and it was winter.
I have buddies of mine and stuff that are like, I love what you're doing
We could probably cover more in just a quick phone call than in the entirety of that book
So yeah, that's a good thing
And so you go full time with the music man
And he told my manager that outside of acquiring new properties, he's only working five to six hours a week on it
I've got elona dot dale harmony property investment group.com.
So cool. Where would you guys wanna go?
I think you have phenomenal energy, your attitude's amazing
And I think I may have a super solid idea of how we can help you
And I'm not asking, and I don't even want to ask for my money back
We're very fortunate that we are engaged with work that is meaningful and fulfilling to us
You too, thank you so much.
Do you mind helping me fill it out real quick? We do it over the phone here, it just takes 30 seconds
Right? I don't wanna Crazy man
Just one less important thing before your call with her, I'm gonna send her a quick five minute video
That's all that he needs there
Could you help me fill it out really quick? It's just like a question or two
Morning. Okay. Looks like the earliest we have a Monday would be an 8:00 AM or a 9:00 AM
I love that you guys are already in it and ready to go
I don't know if he's gonna want me to do that
Do you remember anything about that? I know you didn't go through the book
What do you mean by that?
You can't just pick up and go <affirmative> and do as you please Cause you have a job
I would probably say 24 k around there.
Now Steven, we mentioned this a little bit earlier
Yeah, cuz my husband and I went first week of August we were looking at some properties
We could do that, man, but I really believe she's gonna be at the house tomorrow. 11. I mean, okay,
<affirmative>, could you open it up and accept it?
So I tell you what I can do for you man, cause I gotta hop on another call here in a few minutes
That right? Yeah, it's more of a duplex.
It's just me. There's nobody who wants to follow in my path in this life.
Three months too long. <affirmative> seems like it's probably not the most enjoyable situation to be in day to day.
So it really does matter on who you are, what you do, and those problems that you know have to face when some money
I, so I owe basically the military, they spent a bunch of money on my training
So from person to person I won't have to worry about that
For sure. You think's really stopped you from diving in and actually getting into real estate or getting into Airbnb?
Let me see if I can find it
I think it's just for the financial freedom and I'm still kind of working on it with Covid
It's kind of been a little bit tricky, but yeah, <laugh>
Yeah, there's kind of a, it's a easy example to think about it this way
Tell me about that. Are you guys paying the mortgage on that or are you guys cash off that
So feel free to accept that after the call or after this call
Oh, info's already even taken out then?
Well, would you be able to, to spend spare maybe two hours per week to put towards something like this?
Yeah, I had six older cars when I was 16 years old. Wow. About a 72 Dodge Charger when I was 14
Yeah, so I do it work, I'm IT technician at the airport.
And that's just been my problem
Yeah, for sure. And would you be able to decrease your hours pretty easily as far as your other gig?
So if you just go on the high side 110, that's only 40,000 a year
Take the first 2,500 then after that. Yeah.
Did you ever get started with Airbnb or not yet?
I'll shoot it to you right after this and great getting to know you, Richard, and we'll talk soon
I took it out of both
Let's see if we can do something after you get off at two tomorrow, or are you heading up to the mountain tomorrow afternoon?
I never came It never in the mail.
Yeah, I mean it would be something I'd like to do
I just have a hard time kind of getting that starting point
There. Okay, sorry about that Mike. Right, so giving them stats again. You said what? You said 150 million. What? Those are some serious numbers. You
At the end of the day, money is really cool to get what you want
Would you guys both then a hundred percent be able to be on the call together at seven o'clock on Tuesday?
And we can show, there's a lot of little tweaks, lot of little tweaks to be able to do that
He's part of the learning how to be successful on Airbnb, that program
How you doing? It's who? Sorry
Okay. And I just wanna correct the name because it's not Don Stratton, it is whom?
Mostly, I'm pretty sure what I did is did the audio portion of it and then the digital
I actually saw a massive Airbnb
And just one last thing, anytime I do schedule someone for Mr
And dozens of people have actually even climbed up to the seven figure mark, which is pretty astounding
Why not? I mean, heck dude, whatever goal you set, that's gonna be the thing you chase after
Is it an Airbook ebook? I'm sorry, ebook or,
Let me see if I can get you some resources and help you out
And so I'm just gonna get you scheduled in here and get you confirm
Cool. And then what is your credit score? Do you know what that is? Last time you checked?
Edward, do you have access to the Wisdom Enterprises email? Because it may have sent the link over there automatically initially. So
But due to the summer, got slow
And that's really kind of the right thing to do right there it is
<affirmative> buy me a nice little something
How much? You said how awesome it is. I mean right now it's just comfortable but not awesome.
I learn how to do it, you can do it, and here's how I got started and go from there
If I stretch myself too cent
And since you're someone that's kind of been in limbo, it's something you obviously see the possibility
Yeah, cause if something's making money, something's making me money, I'm definitely willing to give some back to reinvest
So do you think you're trying to replace the income you're getting from that business? Is that kind of a starting point?
Probably a little less, I'm being honest.
Yeah, and it'd probably be about 45 to 60 minutes.
You guys don't have to be together
I don't have that cold of a heart,
Just wanna make sure Cause I'm like I don't wanna be, somebody's trying to sell me for an hour
I have my own, almost took a lot of time, a lot of my time health know spot business
I do my most absolute busiest day of the week is Fridays
I'm just curious. Why 10 Airbnbs
2:00 PM would be the better time. Yeah,
And it looks like we speak with Mr
Okay. I don't really use the calendars on this.
Okay. In time. 4:00 PM a hundred percent. That works.
They're actually far more equipped at getting new results, helping you get started than I am
I love it. I love it. Have you been there before?
Yeah, we just haven't, haven't got there man
So I'm gonna put you with Mr
And then a couple things here, just gotta make sure to lock it in
Yeah, so he's like, he's netting like $25,000 a month passively.
Well that would be a I guess again, once we get our first property under our belt, obviously success is definitely a drive
Yeah, I'll schedule it, get you in a calendar invite and then he's gonna call you.
And he told my manager that outside of acquiring new properties, he's only working about five to six hours a week on this.
So Donny, you mentioned this is part of some of the goals you have lay this year
Okay, cool. And then would you be able to do 11:00 AM Eastern on Tuesday morning?
Yep, I can do that. I'm just searching for my wallet right now. Throw that in the toilet
And I hate Pete ever have to pay that
What I wanna do is, what we like to do is we know that a lot of people are in limbo like that
Perfect. Got you set up. We'll get you locked in here and I'll send you all the information. Okay,
Five hours per week? I don't think I can do it five
And then I have, so my frame of thinking, I would rather have more days booked
And I just love to travel
Cause you gotta set the houses up and everything
Diane resend your login credentials just so at the top of your inbox and you access it easily
Okay. So what are you doing right now for work?
Are you in real estate right now?
I'm kind of a home by these kind of focused on my goals right now
Goal and that's the smart thing to do. That's the business owner mentality of putting your money to work
I'll text you as well so you have my number
And they're going to modesty carol@yahoo.com?
Of course, anybody will be interested
And my goal was just to make to clear after all expenses no less than $1,500
And so you being as far along as you are, you could start killing it, killing it with this
<affirmative> say you're even bringing in 50 K a month at some
The last time I checked it was like at 7 27 15.
You definitely exceed the basic qualifications we would typically recommend
In free cash flow? If I wanna make my goal retired dad and mom is most important and then me, I need probably about 45,000
Would you kind of just start there and then keep going from there?
I'm trying to catch up with my schoolwork actually in college at the moment
Two hours per week? Only two hours. Are you sure? Yeah. You mean I can get a five days of property, but do I have a
So is there any reason I wouldn't be able to make it?
I'm not so sure about that. You're gonna ask me the questions now for him, or he's gonna ask me questions about that then.
But again it's being nailed down long enough to get anything set up and Sure
So what I'll do right after this call, I'll text you and Mr
I bought a new car recently so I'm an okay job, but I don't see myself doing this long term
She got 18 units in her first month, 18 unit
But I figured to myself, well, I guess it wasn't meant to be, so I just didn't really worry about the $20
Yes, I do. Yes I do. And I've never done anything with it. Yes,
I I'm fan that I'm really short on time
So if we agree on a time right now, I'll be there
Well, hey, the reason that I'm calling and don't worry, not here to sell you something
Yeah, it's seven 30 my time
That should be able to contact that
So like I said, I don't get too high, I don't get too low
I mean, I have a bunch of invested capital right now and I didn't really want to pull it out and do something risky
Something It was a while back.
But I'd like to do that with my new wife and stuff
I just, life I lost 20 people and I mean 15 people in 2020
I'm just on the success team, man
And yeah, I mean you even had a head start, so that's awesome to hear
Okay. Okay. Yeah, let's do that. It would need to be like that
By this time I don't be feel like talking to nobody but
There's some weeks where it's five some weeks where it's two some weeks where it's 10
Would you be at home during that time?
We could do Monday or Tuesday. In what time zone will you be in on Monday?
A lot. That's fine. You can just give a ballpark. Okay. What's a lot?
No, it's pretty much become a full-time job
Is that something that you would be against?
And that's what I've been trying to get a little bit better at, I guess you could say
I'll see his name on his Z
Okay, well then it'll good to go man. <laugh> five hotels.
Okay. That's awesome. How much do you need? Do you already have resorts you're looking at or do you kind of
Yeah, dude, that'd be great to start with. Could you imagine, just imagine having an extra 10 to 15,000 a month coming
If there is a link or a button that we can push if we forgot the password or have some issues, if
So for you it's like getting back in the saddle cause it sounds like, so you've been an entrepreneur for a while now
We show everyone typically who we work with, how to maximize all the tax writeoffs, tons of tax incentives
We actually have full-time executive consultants
And then based off of that and some other context
But for the most part I'm super happy
Can you help me fill out really quick just two questions?
And maybe it's not as bad as I'm making an out to be, so
Vaguely. That was like, I don't remember when I bought the course. It was maybe a years ago. So yeah,
So I'm on the student success team
I've been to Oregon, it's been about four or five days in Oregon
So they regularly charge about a thousand dollars just for a single minute consulting session
I mean, I appreciate it. I hope this is a new beginning. I thank you for your help.
We normally never book these farther than 48 hours in advance, but the schedules only open until Saturday
I appreciate you your willingness to look so much as well
Exactly that. I mean it, I'd be able to do those things. I wouldn't have to worry about a lot of things.
And maybe you wanna do that long term
Well it sounds like this is pretty good timing
He's basically done the Airbnb arbitrage, kind of rinse and repeat
So I do make money, it's just totally down
And what would that allow you to do if you had that amount of income coming in from Airbnb in addition?
He literally has a hundred percent success rate with his students
So he's growing up pretty fast and just being around to, I just talk to him, discipline, all kind of stuff
Unfortunately, we only book these appointments out about 48 hours out in advance, so I don't even have the schedule open past Tuesday
All right, Perfect. I appreciate it. And you said it was Thomas, right?
Is it your first unit that you're putting up?
And if we can't help them then we just rather would buy them out
I went and started a Airbnb within what 30 day or 60 day program monthly or something like that. And I never got reimbursed.
The first is just what's your credit score?
It feels like my second home
So you're at six 80 credit score 55 K income, and you have about 21 K saved up
<affirmative>, you work quite a bit on that company
Oh, it will definitely set her up for success in everything basically. It
And we get about one property every 45 days and our average property nets about $2,000 per month
So not a crazy amount of time, but a little bit of time
So really what they do is Airbnb consulting, but just overall business and mindset strategy consulting
For you it's creating generational wealth, making an impact for your family and providing for others
And Brian Page had his unit rented out for 90 days straight, not a single day vacant and was charging double the price
Yeah, yeah. Oh shit. No, I'm actually gonna be in the mountains on Saturday
That would be an incredible start I guess you could say
They feel like you're a good fit
So as long as you show up, you'll be fully refunded
Do any of those things resonate with you or?
<affirmative>. And how many months would you say, have you been somewhat looking into teetering and talking to landlords?
But it's a great time to talk about this and include this in my plan if fits
So I would tell you I am basically two hours from South Padre Island.
That's great. That's great to hear.
Awesome. That I have. I wanna log and shows
Well, as you know, the market has changed a bit
Well, thank you. How are you?
It's just what they make us do here, and so I don't wanna have any bad taste in the mouth after
So is that what you're talking about?
Oh no, how much, Sorry, your miscommunication. That was how much I have sand up, saved up. Annual income is 55.
We can do it over the phone
At least for a good amount of time
Yeah, no, I definitely I understand everything you're saying and there's the opportunity that I wouldn't wanna pass up
Yes. Yep, totally. You're in a good spot.
You gotta brush your teeth and go to bed
So it's six 40 credit 1 0 8 income, about 40,000 in capital.
You can partner with other landlords, you can partner with other people who have more capital
So you have a 45 minute gap open at 12 or one or 3:00 PM
I will. I'm gonna reach out to Diane right now to have her resend you your login to the email that we have on file.
I just ain't got just hang out all the way situated with everything I need
I, I made a lot of money during that timeframe
All you have to do is watch that video
Cause everybody financial situation is different and all of us mentality is different
I'm fantastic man. Just changing a couple lives today, feeling great about it.
I've been at Target for where I'm at 17 years.
Yeah, absolutely. You text it to me. Yeah.
And then how much are you guys working now just to get some context of where you're at
What is it for you guys?
But what is it for you? I know you said more time at home
So with crypto and everything, yes I have more crypto than $5,000
Kind of just bringing up to speed there
I can definitely talk to Brian and see who we know that's in the Houston area and potentially put you in contact with him
Just make sure that you guys can have the best call together with your time
This is the most major town from Calgary to here
1:00 PM Yeah, 1:00 PM is good. That's when I'm moving about and
It's, it's not a necessity for me
Just a lot of people, they don't even take the action on the course
So I'm firing all cylinders right now, <affirmative> and that's what it's about
1230. And so you have 1230. 1230, you could do 1230 to one 15.
I think you guys will really get along
I'll lock it in, send you over a calendar invite and we'll go from there
Looking on my calendar right now
But we have probably been, Do you know how long from the day we bought it, how long we have to consume the material?
I don't wanna have to waste my time doing yard work and cleaning my house and things like that
So an Eastern standard. It looks like we have a few shots open tomorrow. Do you work during the day?
I can't give you a firm answer on that right now
I'll just check to make sure
It's just that fear, that anxiety, that unknown of going out and getting your first one
Let us see. Wow, I didn't know it dropped out. Well, 6 28.
I got a collection at first
My parents paid for my school, my tuition, everything
Cuz she doesn't really enjoy her job that much anymore
Yeah, I think I type in six, like five three or something
So <affirmative>, I don't wanna let you down at
Yeah. So I mean I pay myself right at a thousand dollars a week.
Friday, November 12th at 3:00 PM
Yep. We'll I'm put you with our head guy, Mr. Goer. So Ben Goer, he'll just give you a phone call at 1130 Central tomorrow morning.
I plan to refinance 'em cuz they're all gonna have equity
And I got a line on a motor home that's really priced real well
Oh, well, before we go any further I can just get that fixed you right now
So that'd be the goal to basically stop that process or whatever you wanna call it
Yeah, they're all in my wallet.
I do pretty well. I'll probably sitting at about three 50 a year to four a year.
For sure. So I'd have to look at the calendar first, but how's that sound?
<laugh>. Awesome. And how long have you done that for
And it sounds like for you getting to 20, $30,000 a month, Airbnb business is successful
Not much. Only a couple grand.
And the reason why we have that in place is just obviously we want to protect our executive consultant's time
Until I get something better or create something
I can never <affirmative> so that I can get it
So in a perfect world, no boundaries, what's kind of like that ideal monthly income you'd be hoping to get to with this
That helps you get from where you are to where you wanna be
Right? That's it. You spell my last name? H E R r O d.
<laugh> take to take her? Maybe to win to Italy? Win, Yeah, Italy. Yeah, right. France in itch, somewhere like that. Yeah,
He's got 14 properties and he is netting about $25,000 a month
Hey, it's Cooper with BMV Formula from Brian Page's team. How you doing?
All right man, so you're locked in and hi him
So the earliest I could make the call would probably be Monday or Tuesday
One may work better than 11.
And first I got a doctor's appointment around one
Yeah, definitely. Okay. What would you do with some of the extra cash
So that makes things a little difficult
I'm only pace you over a hundred
That will be an absolute have not having physically put the effort like that every single day to actually get a real rest
I gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. So you just split the profits after what the rent would've been. Right,
So you're clearing less than that? Yes
And so I'm really thrilled about that in terms of paying off my college debt
He doesn't have any after four 30 on Thursday, however he does have a 6:00 PM on Friday in Eastern time
Let's see here. Probably 5:00 PM Yeah.
So one last thing I'm required to do is just fill out a little form so that Mr
<affirmative>. So if you got 200 a year and passive income, you'd basically good to go. And
There's like TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian, but just ballpark kind of the average of those
Well hey, we're a little bit newer to the whole Airbnb business
I don't feel like it right now. I'm like, oh my gosh, how do you lose a wallet? This is ridiculous. Oh
That would be obviously a weight lifted, so that would definitely be a good thing for me.
So you're to go, man, it just finalized
Yeah, r a b r i a l zero one.
I don't want to die a piece of crap.
Yeah. What do you mean first, millionaire?
I mean, yeah, man. I mean, I know, gotta listen. Not today, but yeah, sometimes this week or
My dad, he has a house now and he's not in the best neighborhood
Can't I remember his name? I'm sorry, I, I'm just trying to put it together
Yeah, at the time, yeah, I was thinking about doing it, but now I don't have a property. Don't know
Enjoy the rest of your Monday, okay?
What's that for you having to run all that management and deal with the rising cost? Is it inside the business
That is a hundred percent the way to go
The fact that one can generate money without really owning the property.
Okay, so you said tomorrow would better for you just in terms of time available?
All right. What was your name again?
Is there anyone else that would be involved in your Airbnb
Okay. What would you do with an extra hundred K a month coming in? I mean, what would change for you personally?
Unfortunately it's down in the 500
But that'll be a good starting point for right now
I know there's other websites that you could put 'em on
Okay, cool. You checking your calendar like a hundred percent, you can make three 30.
Well I could probably step back from my other job <laugh> that would replace that income
I would really like to take that and invest into some real estate because that's the ultimate goal for me
I'm gonna text this to you first
And I like to give it an honest try, but here's the deal
Well, here's my thought process with this
So let's say I do that and I start getting an Airbnb set up
I can work six days a week
And so how much available capital do you have, whether it's in savings or stocks or 401k to put into leases on these properties
I'd probably, I <inaudible> investing money in stock market.
So yeah, I mean I've been growing
Rogers know that you're committed to watching the video and you'll be ready to go at one 30 tomorrow
But the few that did had really incredible success and saw some results
Oh, gotcha. Okay. And so how far away from next year?
Sure, yeah, I mean I think we both have watched it
That's taking up a lot of your time and your attention recently in life
No, cause no, no. I won't have some other things that can handle right now.
I'm sorry, could you repeat that real quick? I didn't hear the
He's got a TV show, tons of different programs
Right, Okay. How do you think she would feel if you moved her out into town, was able to help her out more?
He'll be able to take care of you
And then when I get to Alabama, that's when I'll be back and forth full force, a hundred percent doing the same thing again
More like taking trips with my kids and my family
You <laugh>, appreciate man. I just hope you write about me in your book when you blow up <laugh>, <laugh>.
I mean it just doesn't make sense to me
So if you guys can't show up to the call focus, you just randomly cancel or no-show something like that
A lot the, not only would my life change, but the lives of people closest to me would definitely drastically change directly
I heard it in your voice and that's why I offered it to you
Do you remember purchasing that book on how to start an Airbnb business without owning property while back?
Okay. Last question for you Thomas <affirmative>, how many Airbnb properties do you have?
So he just gives me five minutes to check in with folks just to see if there's any way that we can help out
I mean, right now we've got hundreds of multi six figure Airbnb beers and dozens of seven figure Airbnb beers
I'm in Central. I live in Texas.
So in a perfect world, no boundaries
So obviously the first thing they look at when you're getting the lease is your credit score
So that just kind of gives you an idea of what's possible, but Well, how
Oh like I said, the program is cool but I don't know
What the heck? Oh my goodness
And I can get you scheduled with that call if you wanna do that
Last time I checked should be like 7 27 25.
Rob, you got it in there?
Okay. Yep, for sure. Gotcha. And then how much is super liquid cash or credit card?
So say if you were making an extra $10,000 a month or something, what would you do with that?
Oh yeah, sure. Yeah, no, I'll be there. Is it I don't see a Zoom link or anything. Is it gonna be,
Okay, understood. That makes sense. So do you have a job right now? Is the job that you do is it doesn't cover come with insurance?
Yeah, but I don't like that. I don't, cause I don't wanna do that. I'm not gonna do that, but I would. No,
Yeah, eight o'clock I'll be in the house, man. I'll be ready waiting on your call by that time. I'm definitely will be ready.
It's just so hard to tell cuz I've invested so much into furniture and security deposits into just first month's rent
<affirmative>, I can totally level with you there
I don't really spend my money, blah blah blah
And I'd hate for you to ever have to pay that
Cool. And then last question, what's your annual income between those two
Do you want me to do the get started thing or?
And so let's say you do that, you reinvest again, and then you reinvest again, and then you reinvest again
So is there any reason why you wouldn't be able to make the call today? I
So I'm actually gonna, looks like, yeah, so we're gonna put you with Miss Catherine Funk
I also own a solar sales brokerage
To, just feeling like you have it covered, Bases are covered, Sam's covered, something happens. You got what you need to take care of it.
Or 20 K a month or more. So
But his only availability is tomorrow at two.
All right, got you locked in here
Would you be able to watch that prior to speaking with him on Tuesday?
Brian Page, the guy that wrote the book he's got a ton of students that he works with
So I mean all those <inaudible> <inaudible> driving up and down, you got your chickens, you got your properties working for you
I already have a business coach though
So when that first came out was kinda near the end of what was possible and that kind of a thing
Open a bottle of champagne, go to the next goal, set the next one for 20,000 or 25 or whatever
All right, you too. Thank you so much.
So I wouldn't really know exactly if any of that would be best for you
Well the reason I'm calling and don't worry, not here to sell you something
Wonderful. I'm happy to hear that.
I will make it happen for you, my man
Okay. Yeah. Awesome. Would you like me to break down how that call would go if I could find some availability in their calendar?
So because I have partners when they're all set and done, I probably have 1500 coming in every month, but
That's like a lot of people why we're here
Freeing up my girlfriend so that she doesn't have to work as much or doesn't have to work at all
Rogers is make sure anyone I place on his calendar like this watches an important pre-call video beforehand
<laugh> Miami. So yeah, beautiful down there. Yeah,
I have any time in between that time anybody can call.
That way I know I'm not just spending money on something that I won't be successful at or I don't know any success in
I just wanted to be fully transparent with you, make sure that you could make it
I'm also in real estate looking to buy distressed pop properties from people who need help
No. And how has that been for you?
Did you have a goal income you wanted to make in terms of passive income per year with Airbnb?
So you talk to people <affirmative>, they don't wanna work hard, they wanna work smart
Be able to take care of that
I would say about 10 grand. Okay. But that's what I'm doing now is working on funding, so I should actually have more this month.
Just send it over to you
Joe, just so you know, the reason that actually Joe, by Go, did you, sorry, do you go by Joe or Joseph?
<laugh> just, Oh yeah, this is probably not a good time
<affirmative>, have you checked the toilet?
Well, yeah, so just to give you some context, we actually have a guy that started last year and he's already got 12 properties
You can just throw me a ballpark
I want to improve as I grow and perfect it better
And then the only other thing before the call is Mr
Working for. And how long have you been working for other people?
I mean, I need to be realistic
I've actually automated most of my solar company cuz I've had it a lot longer
You're welcome. And just to confirm, are you in Eastern time zone?
And she's not married and so she needs someone to take care of her older
Okay, understood. Well then can you guys both a hundred percent be on the call on Tuesday at seven o'clock?
This is such a rural area and no one wants to stay here
So are you familiar with the rental arbitrage model that was talked about in the book?
And then whenever you're ready, the card number four digits at a time from left to right, please.
But for you specifically, why is having choices important to you?
Or did leasing a house with, they leave their furniture there or do you have to buy your own furniture?
So a lot of times when getting homes, they're gonna look at your income and your credit score
Yeah, well I have my paper out and stuff to take down whatever I have to take down and see what the deal is.
Oh yeah. That was a long time ago. Yeah, I remember.
Business. Sure thing I can do a noon.
So on our team we have full-time executive consultants
Yeah, I'm working the rest of today and tomorrow.
Has that been something that been in jeopardy?
She'll just call you on the phone. Oh,
Cause that's seems like that's where the money's at right now
Hey Raymond, it's Thomas. It's giving you a call back. How you doing man? Thank
Basically. Did know the top of your head?
Just shooting you a calendar invite here right now
I mean just for you probably just you have an individual.
Hey, this is Thomas with B Formula
No, I think four is great. Four is great. Cause when I know I'll be without distractions, so that's a good time.
So just really quick Ill be back, stay on the call 30 seconds and I'll get you on the calendar. Right,
Would you be able to watch that before you speak with her tomorrow?
So they'll call in and I have to get online
The Airbnb is something I was gonna do regardless
I mean, I have to do some more research on closed on it and close on two in California about a month ago
$10,000 a month is a starting point and you said you wanted stop there
Hey, Jonathan, this is Cooper. I actually work with Brian Page. Hopefully that name rings a bell. How's everything today?
Yeah, a hundred percent. What's the other one?
. You haven't thought of that yet.
So that's kind of where I'm at with that
Why is that important to you?
A lot of folks were able to quit their job and go full time with Airbnb
Oh, I know. I all panicked about what in the world I might have done with this. Oh, okay. This is not, I actually just,
And I mean that's the smart thing to do
So I mentioned the video, and so Mr
Do you mind helping me fill it out real quick? It's just three quick questions
Yeah, for sure. And is that cuz you want some sort of time freedom, financial freedom to buy back in time?
So looks like we're locked in and I'll make sure to let Mr
Am actually off on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Is there any time slots available? And that,
So what are we consulting? Are they just trying to get me more into it, or what is it all consist of?
Yeah, so I'm not trying to waste your time, but No, I'm curious
<affirmative>. And do you have any experience in real estate or any prior experience with Airbnb?
Right. So in terms of that, do you know what your credit score is last time you checked?
They got somebody supposed to be funding everything for you and you split it half with them
So I'm building a additional dwelling unit onto one of my properties and so soon where it is legal to do Airbnb
And so especially considering there are only a finite amount of spots available on the calendar, and typically it is a $2,000 time slot
I was even, me and a friend of mine was thinking of becoming partners
More recently. Why do you think that is?
And is carlos.lc 22 at Hotmail your best email address?
And so we can just get you booked in for a time with them right now
I mean I just went to Paris in the summer so I want to go back there
Well, last year mean, well not last year, I mean this year already I'm a little over a hundred K last year
They work directly with Brian Page himself and regularly get paid $2,000 for just a single hour of consulting
Okay, sorry, you're kind of there for a second
Is there anything I need to do before the meeting?
I'm at a love that. Cool brother. Let's see here. Which time zone are you in?
Million a year, five years. I have five years where I'm making a million a year and they'll be a lot better off for that so
Yeah it sounds like five to 10 may might just be more of a starting point
So tell, what's the guy name that I'm talking about?
But I'd have to have more than one 10 grand a month
I just realized for whatever reason I didn't even fill out your information to click the submit and get you in real quick
I'm curious for you, I mean, got you fired up about Airbnb in the first place
So that'd be between eight and $9,000 a month roughly
And what made you feel more excited? What made you feel excited about getting into Airbnb in the first place?
No, you won't have to worry.
It's all based on the data and everything like that
I was outta work but got back in, started a consulting company doing well now
Right. Well Dana, I've really enjoyed talking and I'm excited to see Call
And so we're really just doing this big push right now to help people get better results and to increase our student success rate
Just curious of what attracts you to Airbnb?
So just so that he's fully aware, is there anyone else that would be involved in your Airbnb business or is it just you?
So I just wanted to be fully transparent with you, make sure that you could make it
Do you see any other links inside that first email
We've had over 50,000 people purchase the course and most people never got started
And what about on the big end? Like big goal?
Oh I pretty much work five, six days a week right now. Do
So I've got plenty of cash to work with.
I'd hate for you to ever have to pay that
Do you want to just do wanna try to give your guy another call here one more time before we part ways?
That's the biggest thing is approaching landlords and getting 'em to say yes
We've got dave cap capital gateway
Okay. All right. Could you give me two seconds here?
I've been doing oh God, intermittent fasting <affirmative> and just making sure I'm watching my caloric intake day to day
You're be able to tell your friend about Airbnb financial freedom, generational wealth
Is there anything you can do to remind yourself that you'll be getting a call from Mr
Yep, I can do that. And what company
I have an rv, I have a place in Hilton Head
And I supplied them or whatever they needed and then they were happy
So I'm curious, why'd you end up getting the course in the first place?
Well, and the only reason I ask is to figure out where you're at and what's possible
We just schedule a 60 minute block or typically looking to book out either tomorrow or the next day
So I'm gonna reach out to Dan right now, see what happened with that
No, so this is the invoice <affirmative>, and then if you basically probably you'll see an option there to pay the invoice somewhere on the screen.
Renzi. R E N z. I also send you a calendar invite after that, but just wanted to,
Yeah, that's, that's like a milestone. Like oh first a hundred K, okay, so now I'm doing something, now I'm getting somewhere that
Generat is the guy to go to
Oh, okay. So as a recent happened?
The job I have now, it's more of, I don't have a passion for it because it's really monkey work
I, that's just a starting number and then I can gradually grow from there
So <laugh>, everyone starts somewhere, right? And that's typically how it goes in this business
I feel like you should will come with time as you are telling me
The yoga workout was the worst one then
Okay. Saturday as well or what's Saturday looking like?
A year from now I would like it to be able to replace my day job.
I wanna have extra income. I don't wanna rely on my retirement or social security or whatever. I wanna have flow, income, flow,
Then yeah, man, so it's just last week
Okay. And then what's your current annual income also ballpark here?
Because that would enable me in the divorce
I'm doing great, man. Hey, I question, do you remember spending about a thousand dollars with us on the B B formula course a while back?
And unfortunately it, it's just a policy not up to me
I mean there I get to go home pretty much every day other than once in a while I gotta go out of town
So it's kind of all over the place
Pretty good. How's it going yourself?
Awesome. You be able to go through that, maybe take some notes.
An average property net's about $2,000 per month
And so I know you guys are gonna have to get together, kind of figure out the deployment and the game plan
Now I know you don't quite remember and you might not have an exact figure of what you could expect
Not that I can foresee at this moment, no
It's one of our team's goals to find some of our best students and be that skip button so to speak
Absolutely, Absolutely. 100% I watch it. I a couple times.
I ain't got anything to do with, so. Yeah, sure.
During the day I can talk anytime during the day but most of the time at nighttime I'll probably be asleep.
We're Catholic so I wanted to do a kind of a pilgrimage visiting different religious sites and stuff like that
And that way I can manage whoever is in charge of that way better
But really what I do is electrical, wholesale
Okay, gotcha. Sounds good. So do you know anyone that has available capital or credit to help you do some of these deals?
And so all this time is in your time zone, so it'll be 10 central time.
Awesome. And how do you feel like having a successful Airbnb business would allow you those things
Just wanted to double check there
Because specifically I was looking at actually connecting you with Mr
And so I'm curious for you, how's your Airbnb journey going so far?
Okay. So I wouldn't be able to provide that though.
And so Friday is sort of bad too
That's the mindset of a true runner right there
So I guess we're pull a little bit of phone tag here
Don at three o'clock eastern today, Maybe write it down or take a note or set an alarm or anything like that?
I mean, your call might have just may have just come in time
<laugh>. All right, man. Later. Bye.
So what are you bringing home each year between any investments you have or your job as well?
And obviously my previous goal I told you was like well beyond that but yeah
Set. Gotcha. And then what time zone are you guys in over there?
Yeah, totally. Totally. Yeah, you, you're right to the point. Yeah. <affirmative>.
Cuz these guys are literally the best in the business at this
You won't be able to get as much outta it And I wanna make sure you can,
Okay, gotcha. And do you know your credit score? Right now?
Okay, I'll get you confirmed in here
Only probably like 3000 in stock. Not too much.
Yep. I could set that app.
So watching the video all the way through and then making sure you can show up to that time that you commit
Cuz obviously if it's in the contract and it's binded by lease, you physically can't do that cuz it's illegal
And for six months you commit to it, I think 100% you will be successful with it
Actually, yeah, let me see. Actually tomorrow I'm actually free.
So do you know ballpark range, what your credit scores at?
And then between the four, how much credit do you have available on those?
You said you were in Eastern time
I'll text it to you after this call
Don't even feel bad about that
Learn all we can network whatever, reach out to whatever, but to not take action to it until we actually get to Florida
And I'll send you the video as well
I've already sent you an email with a copy of the ebook, so you can definitely have that
He'll probably, it depends on the results
Nice. Okay. Yeah, we we've changed things up a bit since then. Sure. I know that was a while back. Sure.
Yeah, so I'll go ahead and get your pencil in for that and then we'll go ahead and just do the hundred dollars deposit
I like figuring out what kind of payment options I can get for these lease purchases
The booking is concerned but it doesn't have
Okay. So sorry, I wasn't able to fully understand that. Are you currently hosting on Airbnb?
So curious for you, were you able to get started with Airbnb or what's going on?
I'll get that appointment for you finalized with Mr
So I'm curious, how's your Airbnb journey going so far?
Oh no, so you should get two emails
Now, obviously if that's the case, well then yeah, that does require a higher level of investment
If I had my own cash to do that I could
Yeah, free of charge. What do I got to lose?
So I'm happy to provide you with a copy of the ebook right after this
So we have 'em in the family
Catherine Fox needs to figure what's best for you
I don't believe that that's still gonna happen for you
So I'm just, right now I'm <affirmative>, I just spent $2,700 on new furniture
And <laugh>, I mean we've got one guy, I mean he's literally our number one student and number one success story
We were checking in with them two months ago and he's doing about 25 grand net per month
So you're hitting 50 K a month and all I ask Ben, all I ask is that you send me a postcard from Thailand
I don't know, but that you're right. The Colorado River, that rings a bell now that you mentioned it.
Some real people telling the truth and really showing me something or teaching me something or whatever without losing out getting broken and broken
My brother actually is in Virginia Beach out there in the Navy
So you're a little bit ahead
I'll make sure to let Mr
If I can get you on, I can check the calendar here
So where would you wanna get to long term over the course? Three Ks
So we could do in your time zone on Saturday we could do an 11:00 AM
It's both. I can't decide between the two. Both of 'em are important to me.
That's who I would Google if I were, You get a lot more to pull up there
Oh yes, I will be able to be more financially stable, financial free, take that time to invest in other things. Travel, I mean, thank you.
I will email that to you right after this
No, I'm sure there's lots of fine tuning we can do
But if he's not then I'll have someone here to help me watch him
Hey Victor, this is Thomas with b and b Formula
Cause sometimes you get those, even though I'll, it doesn't matter
One, I care about my friends and my family and two all the success in the world
Seven 30. And then the second thing that they usually look at is annual verifiable income. So you said you're at 150 to 200 right now?
Yeah, I hear where you coming from, but I'm not going to be able to do it then if you can't share
I love that you share and you can just really recognizing that you're someone that's been blessed
Well, I'm at the end of my rope.
So it's four 15 over here
So on Wednesday with your call with Miss Funk, who's one of our site consultants it's gonna really help her
I mean it's like I'm feel partially distracted even at home because I just have so much on my plate
There's a lot of nuance to it and I'd love to go into it, but that's like, that's more of a 45 minute conversation
In fact, I was just sitting at the dinner table when you called
But in order to be just straight mean, just for me to be good, I say about four grand a month minimum, bare
If you recall, you got Brian's book a few weeks ago on how to create financial independence to Airbnbs
And in my area, my rural area, there's not a lot of comparisons at all
10:00 AM central? Sounds good. Yep.
Cause I don't wanna waste their time and I don't wanna not, didn't ask what the things I may have wanted to ask
Must be something. It must be something, man.
I have a bunch of notes in here of us reaching out to you before and you said talk to me later
So let me give you mine,
<laugh> question for you man. Hey, do you remember spending about a thousand dollars with us on the B formula course?
I can send you an email confirmation as well as a calendar invite right after this so you'll have everything
And maybe even the time freedom. Cause I know you said you would want to spend more time with the family.
Okay. And how much of that is checking? How much is crypto
Yes, I definitely would be interested in that.
And the reason why we have that policy in place is just obviously we want to protect our executive consultant time
I don't know, I take a lot of new things
Yeah. Hell yeah. So would you go on vacation down to Miami?
And honestly that's the best part of my job
I don't have any kids or anything so I'm just looking to start off around the 10,000 range
<affirmative>, that little to help you, your first property there downhill
And we've made seven bunch of six figure Airbnb beers, tons of seven figure Airbnb beers
Central or eastern? Eastern? I'm in eastern central
Well, just yesterday, my granddaughter and I are planning a trip to go to Europe.
A lot of people Okay yeah
So I can get you on with one of these guys and you're already invested with us, you already got the course
We haven't reached a zero level yet, should I say
By the end of Mark, she'll have pretty much $0, but that's about credit cards at the moment
Yeah, well, gotcha. So you're about 700 credit score, 75, 85 income and about 10 K in available capital for deposits.
Do you mind helping me fill that really quick? Fill
Brandice, I don't know if you remember or not
So I felt like it'd would be a good idea
Let's see if that, Okay, right here we go
Got it. So it's your name, j A C k, Callie jet bev.com.
Geez, <laugh> you asked me would it be anything that'll come up cause me to not make the call
Okay, cool. Cool. That's a cool name by the way man. I've never seen anything like that. That's awesome.
Okay. Do you know what your credit score is at?
Yeah, we might could do that, but I'm just wanna make sure you understand
You can be your own boss
This is leaving money for your family and paying off the hospital bills
All right, Lona, good talking to you. Good getting to know you and we will talk to you soon. Okay.
If it works, I'm extremely happy and I'm glad it's working
She's gonna take care of you
And he told my manager that outside of acquiring new places, he's only working five to six hours per week on the business
So that was of backing off and focusing on developing my psychology practice
Yeah, I don't worry. I'm gonna be in my room with a nopa questions.
Yeah, it's so funny because we were making these calls, just reaching out to folks, seeing how we can get more people, better results
And then his final thing, Wally, I love it
You can create something and with Airbnb that's what you can do
It can be a really great way to cap your risk
So it is about the money
Yeah. So are you working quite a bit now? Are you not financially free with your other businesses?
All right, well you want me to break down how that call would go if I can find some availability in their calendar?
So that's who you'll be speaking with on Thursday, I appreciate
Yeah, I can do seven. Okay.
They work with Brian Page directly
Typically we see about a two to three x return that you pay for rent
I'm just saying that's like a milestone now we can, we're at a different place than we are right now
I haven't finished the course yet.
<laugh>, I set it on my schedule already and I will place an alarm on there so we won't miss these.
I mean I'm, I've got 50,000 in my checking account
And I think that I had even at some point in time, let see if I have an folder for him
So I would say like 8 15 8, 8 20, probably eight 20 would be best
I get to just call people up and hook 'em up with some cool materials and resources
We have to leave the calendars open for the paid consultation
It's just more capital bring in more capital for me. I was going.
Of course. All right, take care.
And what we've found is that these folks are able to acquire one new property every 45 days
Best? All that to the music stuff.
Okay. Have a great day. You as well, man.
Ah, one hell set this time. Okay.
A little bit of time right now
It would just be to see, hey what can we do? These guys have a ton of experience
Usually what we see, how much it takes to get in that first property
And then he told my manager, outside of acquiring new properties, he's only working about five to six hours per week on this
Well, I mean own my own business. I have a process of company, so I process.
So that's B E N O I T
<laugh> really the only answer I got
I know it's been a while since the book
And I, I'll see these all capital contacts come up on my phone
I mean that's one of the first parts
I'm like, what? Who is even calling? I feel like half the time's not even a real person
Well since you're already proven you can get some results to Airbnb
Yeah, no, that's pretty good. Like I said, dude, that's pretty exciting.
If it's 45 minutes I could do that
Okay. That's it. I just wanted to make sure you hit it correct? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I should be able to watch that video.
We gotta get locked in that time with Mr
We are anywhere from 10 to 14,000 a month.
I see about the course on June or June 3rd looks like
No problem. You take care now. We'll talk to you soon.
At first? I mean honestly at first it would be just accumulating and if it has to be anything, it would be break even
We haven't put anything on the website about it yet
Would you say? I'm in from northeast Ohio.
And part of my job is to help some of our beginning students jumpstart their Airbnb business and seriously get results
But sounds like you're free at one 30 tomorrow, so it shouldn't be an issue for you
All I'll have to do is say it's it'ss email 30 minutes earlier, notification per minutes DMV from Okay, November 15th I screenshot it
Must, sorry I've got furniture being delivered on the seventh
Awesome. Great man. What time zone are you in?
But after doing some number crunching, I was like wow, the ROI on Airbnb is crazy compared to let's say long term rentals
Yeah, I was trying to learn more about that.
Really it comes down to I have a lot of my capital and crypto right now and I'm not looking to liquidate it just yet
Yeah if the timeline correlate then yeah, she would be available as well.
So it really just depends on
And you see real estate as a way to build wealth and you see Airbnb as a way to generate that cash flow every month
Hey, Lall is, Is it Scott or Lall?
I've been doing that since April Construction. Since April. I just started security three weeks ago.
One more time with the zip code.
Only reason I ask is it is super important
It looks like they are booked up the rest of the day, but we do have a few time slots available tomorrow
A lot of people lack that or they lack a formula or framework to be able to get those things
I mean is that something you'd be opposed to doing?
So do you mind help me fill that out real quick, Just three questions
And do you know anything about Loughlin, Nevada?
So she won't be working tonight, but tomorrow first thing in the morning, she'll be on it and get that sent out to you
I'm excited too. Hopefully it goes well.
But if you can make 10:00 AM on Wednesday, then it shouldn't be an issue
Joe, okay. I'm speaking fast. Yeah, I go by Thomas. I go by Thomas. Yeah, Thomas.
So it looks like we're locked in and I'll make sure to let Mr
So you're actually on the calendar for our executive consultant and right now is Drew Coates Gmail your best email?
Okay. I'm gonna put this in here. Good enough for the mortgage people. Okay. What's your current annual income?
So we'll have this logging credentials
I'm just trying to leave plenty and have the best experiences I can <affirmative>
All I can make my own schedule
Currently and with passive? Just a few hundred a month off of a sales commission from an insurance job
So is it one o'clock be right now?
Huh. Wonder why your profit's so low? How's the occupancy rate?
Yeah, now it's asking me for my password. Sorry, it's like making me sign into my Gmail.
A blue Kanye, blue crown, Kanye.
See that's amazing. So what's right now? What's stopping you from having success with Airbnb?
No. Cause my business is new, so I didn't really make anything to report and stuff.
Like I said, he understands how they'd work
I mean if I can and I don't have to come out any more money cuz I said we don't have any <laugh>, you deal <laugh>.
I mean if you're going to that many places, you'd have to be able to travel with your family several times a year, right?
No, Friday would be definitely better than a Thursday or a Wednesday, but I said Friday, Saturday, something like that
Just somebody who call me to build up my business credit.
So we would be looking at the next couple days just cause we leave the other appointments open for the paid consultations
Yeah, it's fricking beautiful. The weather out here, even this morning, just perfect weather out.
And I mean, we literally have one number one student, our best success story
Change the human race as we know it
Calling Squeaky Clean, this is John.
Do you want me to share it?
<laugh>. Guzman. Oh Guzman, okay. That actually sounds a way cooler. <laugh>, that sounds a little cooler man.
Then you say, Okay, I'm gonna put this property on Airbnb
We need to work on our guidebooks and house rules and all that
Well the reason that I'm actually calling and don't worry, I'm not here to sell you anything
The schedule's just kind of crazy with you and with everything here and unfortunately I can't do anything past two days in the future
And yeah, no one else is involved.
So did you ever consider doing an Airbnb business and hosting some of your own properties?
Yeah, that was a wild be
I just, 11:00 AM Pacific time.
Doing? Well, how you doing? I was like, who's calling me from Missouri? I like, Oh, what's going on here man, You got me thinking
Could you help me fill out some of the information for him? It's just a few questions
So here's what I'm thinking on this
Right. Would your husband be helping you with the Airbnb at all?
So I would just say safe safely, three or $4,000 to get it ready
And so you're in these jobs right now
I think life just have a so flooring company that, the small flooring company that being consumed most of the time,
Yeah, I used to live in New York. So New York is crazy <laugh>. Oh okay.
So it looks like our consultants are booked up through Tuesday, but we do have a 11:00 AM on Wednesday or 4:00 PM
Why is that, specifically, Why is that important to you?
I actually want this to be my last year
So I'm super excited to see those skills
You might hear a little bit of conversation in the background but Yeah man, the yoga
You had no limitations at all
Okay, so 14, $1,500 a month.
All right. A hundred percent. Yeah, bring any, anyone that's partnering or investor with, you can have 'em there too, so they're not left out.
Yeah, I'm actually going through it.
Now obviously if that is the case, that does require a higher level investment
I couldn't get in it. It refused my password or we refused my login information and I just couldn't get into anything.
But what would that be like for you to be able to pay that off?
They work with Brian very, very closely
You get told where to go, not choose where to go
And you know what, I have to hop on another call in a few minutes, but here's what I can do for you
So I'm here to help people out, get them resources and recommendations if I can
Rogers just so he has context of what you can get approved for
Yeah, I'm still working on taxes for this year. They're at the tax lady, but typically around a hundred thousand.
Oh actually if you could make this work, this could work out really nicely
I hadn't been into it as much this past four or five weeks just cuz I've been bouncing around
I'm being ready to fly out
<laugh>. Well there you go. That that's a ballpark range for you. <laugh>,
<affirmative>? Well, my scores usually good, but right now I'm just remodeling
But you need a action implementation, so
And so that's what it is
Well, I mean, know it sound might sound a little silly, but it is different for each person
Awesome. So you guys both wanna be on the call, right?
I'm probably around a seven 30.
I love that you said that
I can ask him what can schedule a one, because he will be the person to drive on Saturday
Have you ever heard of that?
Awesome. Yeah, I'm gonna finish my note taking, finish the book. And you said the minute the video was up, how long?
Now I'm gonna start panicking about where it's at
Just kind of looking at, make some money outside of just work pretty much once I graduate
It looks like it, like it did come through on our side
I typically try to crank out work in the morning and the bus stop for the gym around 11 or 12
And so my frame of reference is a little bit different
You guys come up with it, it'd be awesome to hear
But it had to be the right situation
Honestly the truth ever since I've never even stepped the door as a guest on Airbnb property
It's not to create another stream of income that's gonna require them 20, 30, 40 hours a week
I have also been trying to find the closest place to the United States that is the best weather all year round
Aw man, so that's nice motivational speaker. I appreciate
And what number do you need to hit for that to be your reality?
Why is that one of the number one priorities for you?
Just, I mean, have kids take all your money
And Dustin, what's your last name?
I need more than what I'm doing
Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you so much. I appreciate you guys reaching out.
I've been doing that basically that actually that was one of my first jobs a day camp counselor
Time? Well not on Friday, so.
Sure. I mean, it doesn't cost anything. You'd take an hour call.
I mean to blow off, fuck
They're not even old enough for school yet.
Some people like you wanna just make an extra $2,000 a month
Nothing really at this point. I'm gonna look into that. I guess I just haven't wrote that, the effort to try it yet.
If I was getting you said what would my life look like?
Just so some steps that you might need to take in order to get some results
Okay. And do that, by the way. That is a awesome name. That's a beautiful name. Where are you from?
And then my health took for a toll, went through a crazy divorce and I'm just picking up the pieces and rebuild
And would being at 10 care a month beyond help you with that?
Would 11:00 AM or 5:00 PM work better for you?
Okay, awesome. Would you like me to break down how the call go if I could find some availability in their calendar?
Gross? Probably just mine or mine and my spouse.
So I'm really allowed to hook you up with some free resources to make that happen, to help you get your first Airbnb
Instead, I just go blow it on a fancy car or something, but
So I'm trying to find a way to make some money off of it
About 180 income, about 20 k, 20 grand capital
Oh, yes, yes. Oh, okay. <laugh>. I was like, Yeah. What's your name again?
Oh, there you go. We're not far off. I'm 22 so I'm
Yeah, no, she's proud of me and my sister for sure.
Not just give people money in a sense, Kind of give people more of a soul of an opportunity
Gotcha. And what about winter months?
So the only other thing I'm required to do is just fill out this little form three questions here just so that Mr
I think they all a hundred percent
And that's the case for a lot of people
And then just to double confirm before and lock in here, like eight 30, you'll be good
All right man. Well I'll go ahead and pull their calendars here. Are you in central time zone?
So right now what, sorry, I think cut out for a second
Okay. You're about six 50 credit score, about a hundred K annual income and about a thousand in available capital
So it's been a pleasure talking with you
So I'll be in the field
There's a lot to lots of see that God's made and it's never really have enough time to do it
I do not plan to liquidate those.
So of course I would want to make a little bit more so we can do more <laugh>
If you would pull up which meetings you have for week and try to find something
Well, as far as I know, I we're here and we're in our little routine now until this barge gets loaded. So that's the best bet.
<affirmative> awesome. For sure. And do you not get a ton of time to travel now?
And we're gonna get you set up on a call with Catherine so you're ready to go
Hey, well I'm always trying to make money no matter where we're at in life
And I'll also, so you can get some background on Airbnb, have a little bit more context going in the conversation
Or have someone call me and let me know where I'm staying
<laugh>. I love it. Oh my gosh, that's so cool. I love how
I found it a little difficult to get started
And of course I don't wanna make any commitments to you that I can't keep myself
I said what's that been like for you having to support them with the income you have available?
Yeah, and I just wanna make sure there's no bad blood friction here
Something that you guys can both be on the call
And then do you have the team members in place to be able to allow you to work that little?
Okay, cool. So ballpark range. Do you know what your credit score is at?
And I don't know if I'm getting that from you as much right now
I do have a full-time job lined up that I'm working this summer and in the future
I just wanna take charge of my life
That's my main goal because right now I'm stressed to know in on a day to day basis, paycheck to paycheck
But really if I only just guess really I stayed in the military for the next four years
So that's why that I deal with calls all the time, depending on if it could be for work or not
You can also text me as well too if just in case you don't hear from me
It. All right. Yeah, of course. Take care.
She's learning and he's learning how to play the guitar
I can tell you nothing you can tell me is going to be too much <laugh>
But what I would do is I would still invest, My ultimate goal is still to invest into real estate
Right. And I was looking to hear from you around one.
A lot of times we ask, do you know what your credit score is? Do you have a 700 plus credit score?
Now, I mean obviously if that's the case, that does require a higher level of investment of course
So for 200 K, it sounds like there's still something searching you around that number
Right. No, I totally get that and I'm not worried about it. It's just a little thing that I'm required to do. Cuz sometimes that's, Yeah,
So last year I made 45 initially should be online
There's just like <affirmative> here and there
Butler know that you're fully committed to watching that video
Yeah, I was actually just gonna ask you a couple quick questions here
Benno, just make sure that anyone I place on its calendar watches this video beforehand, takes about 25 minutes
But that why I looked into it and then I found the Airbnb formula
That sounds like it, man. Well, geez have you thought much about doing the rental arbitrage?
I'm not married. I am single.
So as long as you show up, you'll be fully funded
What time zone are you in?
So let's say I wanted to let's say I get home 10 month, 10 months from now and
I'm just putting deal and stuff but trying to get creative while I'm where I'm at now, I guess <laugh>
I'm always so curious cuz I love to travel
I mean we even had one guy who went through the program, actually now one of our consultants, and he's doing 1
I've heard I've people on both sides of the issue
And then he'll be calling you from his work number and then I'll get you finalized in for that time
Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. Just full context. The 15, is that just cash and checkings? That's that's what you have super liquid?
Of course. That's awesome. And if you're making 200, would you leave both real estate and full-time job and at that point what would you do?
And I'm honestly kind of thinking, cuz I mean you're newer to the whole Airbnb thing, but it's actually one of our goals here
Oh, how you gonna send it to me? Email, text?
So the thing is, with my job, I work in the afternoons. Let me think.
What would bring anybody here? There's just nothing here
Oh, really? Huh. Well that's good to hear. Yeah.
So we only have 3:00 PM available on Friday
Oh no, the call typically like 45 to 60 minutes. Okay. That's just about all the time they can allocate. Yeah. Okay.
Okay. So would I go through you all or,
It's hectic hours and it's just time for a change sounds like
All right, Joe, well you are set for that time
Well, I went and bought a piece of property and that helped us
Do you wanna go beyond that?
Are you allowed to go off base every weekend or so?
No, I have another one. That one I haven't used for a couple years.
Cause I do have two children to think about <affirmative>, but I want to just make sure that they're good
Yeah, I think I was in a, Yeah, go ahead
Awesome. And if that happens, we just charge to the card that we have back from when you got the book. All right.
Maybe you wanna transition outta your job
It's up to you guys, but just know I would be okay with it
Do you have any day available from the 13th through the 17th?
So today is today, today's Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
You're able to scale real quick and you don't need hundreds of thousands of dollars
Hey Shta Thomas with b B Formula from Brian Page's team
I'm never afraid to read something right
Stratton know kind of what happened, and I'm sure he'll be looking forward to talking with you and helping you get started the program
And you a hundred percent sure, just before I lock you in, you can make that tomorrow
<affirmative>. And I mean, what else would you do? What would change for you personally?
How it would change your life for you
So do you mind helping me fill that out real quick? It's just three quick questions, we can bang it out over the phone
Christian Brown which is awesome cuz Mr
Yep. Totally agree with you. I think the cash flow from the Airbnb is, to me that's the golden nugget. That's in his model for sure.
And so that is an important factor in terms of what properties can you actually lease is on
Okay. So I have a five 30 or a seven o'clock tomorrow night. What would be safer?
After the call I'll introduce you and Mr
I don't know if I can get results from it
The reason I'm calling you is I'm actually the manager on our student success team worked here for Brian Page
I think I would just up and quit
Free of charge. No fees included in that at all.
No, I'm, my name's Thomas. So Mr. Don is who you will be meeting with on Wednesday. He's
Yeah, seriously, you're in better position, just honestly, man, it's awesome
Typically saw so much that they would actually go on to get more property number 2, 3, 4, and just keep going
Can't forget about, I mean there's other ways to make money
And right now I'm gonna send over a calendar invite to that Gmail address, the CRI 5 55
Yeah. Do you feel like you're, what would I do?
I mean, what's kind of the ideal monthly income you're hoping to get to with Airbnb?
I'm a consult for these guys and I'm cleared that time so that time is for you guys
Yeah, I mean deposits are what, usually a month's rent?
That's all the context that Ms
So just like ballpark range, what's your credit score at right now?
That's just on top of what you're already doing
So eight 30 central time and then I'll put you with Mr
Cool. Super easily avoidable. And then other than that, the call itself a hundred percent free, so no issues there.
Coaching at other places and never really got much out of it
It's like 10 pages or so
We'll figure out something where we can get what you want
I'm gonna guess around 30 K.
I resonate with what you're trying to do and I feel you man
And then this year is less than that just because we didn't have a large project like that
What do you do right now for work?
That's a great thing to do in the winter time and up in there
Okay. Understood. Is that one of the things that you strive for right now? Getting more free time? Having time for you?
Okay, cool. Well I only wanna lock this in if this is something that you truly want do and something that you're excited for. So yeah,
We could maybe get you on for after two tomorrow, and then Saturday is out for you
I've never really been able to get any business actually to give.
So I'm figuring it out man
Cuz you obviously know what it's firsthand to not have that and you wanna create a different situation for your family
So like 5,000 a month just to start with
What I really want is just financial freedom
Let me tell you a little story
I'd put a I I'd to work. So anyways. Yeah, no, that would be nice.
<laugh>. Okay. What's your name again? I'm sorry.
In order for you guys to have a great call, like I said, to get you some good information bring it up to speed
That desert heat, that's like, yeah
I can get more properties. I got my own company.
So here's what I can do for you
But what if I could do this for you? I've got a little bit of power back here
Now tell me your first year.
I got AJ Maniac with two I or manic gmail
Yeah. Is that million in income?
All right, thank you my man. Take it easy.
But sometimes I tend to work too much and so I just have to keep that balance
Sure. How long is the video?
Ben Wa, just make sure anyone I place on the calendar does watch our pre-call video
Tell me your name again, I'm sorry.
I mean since the pandemic, it's really only, it only really affected the Airbnb business for to six months
The specifics, I don't really know how to go about that
It's small so I would just keep it how it is and just have someone pay somebody to run it. <affirmative>, it takes
Okay, then I'll take a look at it and if it makes sense for me, then I'll send it through PayPal
Do, pick what you want. Yeah, what do you want to do? I don't wanna have to do anything. It's what I want to go do.
Alana, Alana, you there? Can you hear me? Hello?
Well I mean I guess I wouldn't say financial freedom
<laugh>. Yeah, for sure. And where do you feel like the drive to want to be financially free that comes from?
So his first name is Ben Goer
Okay. I can watch that tonight.
It was making sure I pay my mortgage or struggling with that, struggling to pay lawyers and that, the whole nine yards on that
That's my true passion actually is just doing the music game for 24 7 actually
Well, I value being able to commit to that
So I'm gonna contact Diane get those leads over to you, see what happens
I know you're definitely super busy running your company and I wanna make sure that Gotcha
Stratton will be happy to hear that
So I'm just gonna fill in some information here. Just your name and whatnot on appointment so they know that they're meeting with Mr. Sterling.
Tomorrow morning? I have a 10:00 AM and then I have a couple slots in the afternoon.
<affirmative>. So you'd go Japanese over German?
Because I was so frustrated at the beginning trying to find the plan B, but everything is like you cannot do it by yourself
And so if there is a conflict, send me a text, let me know and we'll work something out
You're gonna be the first person nodding plan
Formal. Oh, super Supervisory. HR specialist, Human resource specialist.
Everybody else is almost like an employee, you know get paid for the stuff that you pretty much do
But the business itself, it's been pretty good for us
Pretty much that's stuff like that where I work in the assembling those, designing new ones
So you said at five o'clock central time <affirmative>, if you just wanna pull up your iPhone and you go to the clock app?
So here's what I was thinking cuz a lot of times we just email people materials and resources that would be helpful
It doesn't have that cash flow or at least most the way of them done it
Would he be able to make that too?
Immigrants from China, <laugh> or no, Vietnam
It would be worth my time for 10 15 grand from spending effort on it
We've got after 1130 Pacific time
Who doesn't want that? Okay, gotcha
I think we're in the same book but not on the same page.
But I think I get what you're saying. It sounds like you're just like, I know I can do this. And you said,
I'm interested to get some help on my Airbnb business
Cause time is money, it's valuable, of course
And so right now you're trying to get some income together to sleep your family, you, you said
We actually have full time executive consultants who are a lot more equipped at get new results
You can't take that and you can go in the backyard cuz I got a nice big backyard, right? Huge backyard
Well hold on. Now she do work from the house. She can't predict when something's gonna come up.
Two big things. But I did make money though.
Okay. Okay. That sounds good to me. Okay.
Your expectation is kind of high
Say that, Say that once more time. One more time for me please. Sure,
Yeah I think they're actually fucked up. So let's see, I'll check our calendar here. Do you work on Saturdays as well?
The hard thing is not, there's only one other property that's Airbnb on that lake or it, it's just not a big area
Do you want me to share it?
And we're trying increase our student success
But it's possibly, well, I don't know
Double confirm. It looks like that 5:00 PM that is 5:00 PM Eastern today.
<affirmative>. Okay. And do you own your home outright? Do you still have a loan in the home?
And the best phone number is the one that we're talking on right now?
Let me go get my calendar real quick.
Okay man. I surely appreciate it man.
But the obstacle is, I need one, I need my first property
You had me watch that beforehand
And so we wanna be legal and above a board on all of it, but we'll have a second one coming available in July
Binal needs and just making sure we're good here
The way Brian teaches it is typically leasing properties
And I mean you sound like a smart guy
Yeah, just looking for the next third and fourth ones.
Yep, of course, man. All right, Alan, you have a great rest of your day. It was great talking to you.
Okay, so on our team we've got full time executive consultants
Perfect. Sounds good. I will lock it in and send you over a calendar invite right now.
Okay. Well, so let me ask you this. How many hours a week would you say you're working on your Airbnb business?
Now I gotta take a look at the calendar first, see if there's something we could do. But I mean, how's all that sound?
We're in a great spot there, Chris
So if you're not able to show up to the call focus, you just randomly cancel or nohow something like that
But I'll get focused and maybe I'll go to Starbucks every day
So we stayed in some Airbnb when we went on a vacation to Florida
So I just wanted to be fully transparent with you and make sure that you could make it
We would definitely wouldn't want to do that just for you to be able to get the most out of this call
There's any way that we can help you out, hook you up with some resources
I just want to see if it is, I know it's doable, but I wanna see if it's doable for me
And that's actually something that we teach students that we work closely with
Probably pay for my parents' livings to be honest.
And then I just wanted to double check on that and you guys don't have to be physically together
All right, brother. You have a good rest of man,
Thomas. Okay. Thank you. I will do
Perfect for sure. And so what's the goal of this business? What are you looking for?
I guess, yeah, man, it really just depends on a couple different factors that I can break down for you
So that's kind of where I've been putting my attention to right now
How would that feel to be the first one?
And so makes, What's that, Sherry?
Yeah, Chris, it's Cooper over on Brian Page's team. How are you doing?
It's 2030 k so honestly I would travel my fucking ass off <laugh>
However, highly encouraged if you do have extra time, cannot hurt, can only benefit you to glance through the book
I get along with everybody, but I don't know, there's just something about it
I took a semester of covid off
Oh, they're both in Washington, but one's in Eastern and one's down in Tacoma.
Well Charise, I will send that stuff over to you
I have no means of travel <laugh>
And there's some people that make some good money and that's why I chose that
That's a lot of people, man
She works from home, but she should be pretty much there for a call
We literally worked super closely with Brian and is an expert at the B business model
Hey. Oh hey, sorry I lost you for a second.
Is that what drew you to it?
So like 7 26 for you right now? 26. Oh <affirmative>. Siri popped up and was telling you what time it was? <laugh>.
Let's see what we can do here
So like I said, I'm definitely, yeah, this is not no dream I'm going to get into the Airbnb business
So I'd be curious for you, I mean, was there something that got you excited about Airbnb in the first place?
Awesome. And then Lia, do you have an iPhone or an Android?
So the property tax alone absorbs all of what you're getting from your Airbnb
Pay all my bills and everything I can live off of it.
Yeah, mine is about a 7, 7 20.
And to be honest, dude, the book is some good information but super entry level, super basic surface level stuff, it's a really short book
Gotcha. All right. Right, Jonathan. Take care.
We're seeing them within the first three months at about $3,000 a month of passive income
That Bullhead City in Loughlin, it's on the Colorado River and it's about an hour away
So that would just be more of a stepping stone. Cause you would ultimately want to get higher than that.
I'm able to give you this slot completely for free
Does that ring a bell for you? It looks like you purchased his book
So that's actually, I believe so I'll say within the next year
Okay let's do this. Let me put something in on Friday here. Lemme just pull this up. Sorry.
Interesting. What is the subject line of the email that you're open right now?
Okay, sounds good. And remind me here, which you're in central time, correct?
Yeah. So you mentioned financial freedom earlier. What does that mean for you?
<affirmative> And so you're looking at Airbnb cause you saw man, I could start making some passive income with this and it was pretty soon.
I mean, I'm doing good. I mean it was good information. I mean I got what I needed from it.
Okay. Do you know what your credit score is at?
But I mean that's coming up on two years now
Gonna be at the nursing home, picking up furniture and stuff and bringing it Okay
I would love to, just for time consuming
Nah, definitely a means to an end
And they regularly charge about a thousand bucks just for an hour of their consultant
Can you accept it really fast?
Is that something you'd wanna do?
Oh <laugh>. I guess I'm all right.
Kinda like the game plan you guys come up with together and just cuz it'll put a massive smile on my face over here
I would be silly if anyone would say actually 5,000 is just fine
I won't be driving or anything, but I'm just saying I'll get to my work early and I'll do it that way
Elona. Gotcha. I'm so sorry about that. Hey, my name's Cooper. I'm, I'm with b and B Formula on Brian Page's team. How you doing today?
Yeah. And is he gonna be good as well to make the call for that time?
Brian Page wanted me to reach out and give you a call to see how you were doing on your Airbnb journey
It sounds like you guys are looking to scale fast and which is awesome
Pay bills save up for my nieces, all that. Create a legacy for them.
I was down in my South Beach, Miami <affirmative>
In addition to that, outside of acquiring new deals, he's only working about five to six hours a week on the business
So we're out there a few times, but I'll add the calendars up here
Is that something you wanna take advantage of?
But I just don't know where to go or I need some assistance, I need some
I mean, they work directly with Brian Page himself
Yeah, no, no, a hundred percent. I'll definitely watch it before Monday at 12.
And I know that's way possible and God, I'm old, I need to start thinking about retiring
You're gonna be the first person
Hey brother, you're totally good outta the blue and I can hear that you're working
Well I'm not saying we're stop, we're not gonna stop at tan
So I was really looking into it
Okay. And then what is your current annual income ballpark? Here is fine.
So what we'll do here is, and for 11 you guys, a hundred percent will be good for that
All right, man. Yeah, I appreciate you taking the time to call me.
Saturday at three or 2:00 PM
This year probably gonna be more like 1 50, 1 50, 1 75.
When's a good time for me to call you back just for five minutes on Friday? You can call me
Right? And also being young, right? It's right now one of the biggest assets you have is the hustle
So mostly family time is ideal
Okay, so I pulled up Matt's schedule here and he wouldn't be available unfortunately until Monday
I can pick my own hours, I can pick my own salary
Gotcha. Is that what you're bringing home is the owner and the profit off the business?
So in the last two years, as far as paper goes, taxes, stuff like that, you don't have any income that you can report?
And they can lay out exactly what needs to happen in order for you to get results
So you're at about eight 10 credit score two 50 plus annual income
I mean, they're light years ahead of me
Really? So I can't book anything for next week
Who said I have to spend it? Can I just court it, donate
I'd be signing a lease and have to pay rent on something that I may not get anything out of
I'm just thinking here, I'm trying to make sure we're not going to, we are gonna be available on Saturday.
Well, I wanna speak to a coach, someone who actually does it.
Something that I, I've totally forgot about that I wanted to learn
Yeah, I'll be looking forward to that
It's a big expense and if I can make some money off of it or it could pay for itself, then that'd be great
And I'll send you a calendar invite right after this.
So 5:00 PM Just to confirm before we do anything, 5:00 PM central time on Friday the 31st?
A leftover is just go travel
Well, rental arbitrage was something that I've been interested in for about a couple years
Is your best email address d holmes AZ 5 72 gmail.com
I think we actually have some spots open tomorrow
Yeah, I It's alright. It's an alright job. I wouldn't say it's the best star, but it's something.
And now the straight up thing, I don't think I like to invest in nothing that way
It looks like we just scheduled in for Wednesday
In order to protect our executive consultant's time, especially Mr
Lot of women just come out in their own profiles and say, I'm only looking for a guy that has a house
Well, no, that's all expenses, everything.
Right. Sounds good, Ryan. Hey, great getting to know you today and have a great rest of your weekend and we'll talk to you soon.
Now, I mean obviously if that's the case, well then that does require a higher level of investment
Okay. I'm trying not to mumble here, but
So tomorrow I've got a four o'clock, do you wanna just do a four o'clock tomorrow?
I don't sometimes what I'm noticing because see the house is paid for, I don't owe anything on that house
Awesome, awesome. And your time zone, just to confirm again, you're in mountain, right?
Right. Cause you'll hire to clean the company and everything there. Go clean it, turn around for you and
We have one opening on Monday at 12:00 PM We also have a Tuesday around 2:00 PM
Friday and the day. Friday and the day we work.
Okay. 6,500 is what you're netting per month. Okay. Yeah, ideally, I mean are you satisfied with that or would you like to make more?
If I make okay a million dollars, cool
I'm on Los Angeles in the Pasadena area
So maybe 6,000 if I'm doing the math a thousand, a 5,000 for me, a thousand for her
Two, they're just looking for rent, that's all they want to do
Right now. We were just doing that when you called.
So I was like, oh no
Now is this on the W2 or from business?
St. Murray is a college town. Okay. Do you follow the NBA at all?
Going really part of the reason why people like the BNB formula so much
Well I said I'm not leaving next year. So right now that's in. Okay.
Obviously you're not driving or actively working or doing anything
That's what we got going on now
We're a lot more equipped at getting your results than I am giving you recommendations around this
Like you said earlier is said 80 hours a week right now you're working
She can feel happier and says I can give her some fun money
I mean, I spend more time with family and then I can pursue other dreams.
They're docking my pay now a hundred bucks for anyone that doesn't show up to their appointment like this
Really. So I would need to know that I would be able to get good Airbnb income immediately, not take years to create a successful business
I mean probably 50,000 people or more
But if we both can bring ourselves home and reach this goal quicker with a little bit investment, we understand that
I didn't really know what Airbnb was until I actually read your book
I'm gonna shoot you the video, I'll email it to it and text it to you right now
Go ahead and run this and then at the end of your call on Friday, they'll go ahead and just refund it
Okay, right on. Would those be more for pleasure or just also investments?
That's fine. Yeah, it was two or three years ago.
Yeah, no I should be good for one o'clock 11
Let me take a look at, let me just see what I can do here, the detail
What's kind of the ideal income you're hoping to get to with Airbnb?
But it's just picked up more since last May. So yeah, just picked up more.
Like I said earlier, I'm kind of skeptical on it
Sure. Okay. So you, you'd quit your job?
And you see Airbnb as a potential vehicle that would make that happen?
Saturday I've got 10, 10 30 or 1230 Pacific time.
Create generational wealth, create generational wealth break
And okay with having three adult kids, it wouldn't be a bad idea of building something up that we could leave two of them
So is that where you go basically rent from somebody that is renting a house and then basically Airbnb on top of that?
Yeah, that should be no problem.
But I don't know. I don't know
And you said, I think I heard you say that as you got the leads, you did the program again
All right man, I appreciate it, appreciate the time and looking forward to hearing how goes for you.
And I know you know can make a lot more money out than Airbnb than you can't rental
So that's $3,000 a month in essentially passive income in just those three months
They actually work directly with Brian Page himself
And then long term, the next 20 years I'd like to make 10 million a year
It varies a little bit week to week, but that's about the ballpark.
There's another way I can look this up
Who's not happier with more money? <laugh>, I don't know
So at this point I'm really working probably about anywhere from 50 to 60 hours a week regularly within multiple hospitals
It's time to get a return on that investment
So I got it locked and I just saw the invite too
However, there's a ton of advantages for landlords to actually rent their properties to Airbnb hosts
So I'm curious, how's your Airbnb journey going so far?
So I'm curious, you've wanting to do this for a while
Well, of course I'd like to make more. I wouldn't mind making 30 or 40 K a month <laugh>,
I mean, not having a license to get into real estate, but still being the offering that service of Shortterm rental
We just watched that before the call
I'll send you a calendar invite so you have that here
There's things you can do to modify that, but just at the end of the day we know you'll be successful
I'll get you guys in a group chat
But month to month it's more break even
Well, part of the reason we reach out is we're trying to increase our average student results
That's exactly what I use it for now
I know you gotta run Caleb, so I appreciate it and look forward to hearing how it goes, man
My job title is lead item operations specialist
I take that outta my notes, just so I remember
I'm not actually, I think I got the book two years ago, so I honestly don't remember. It's
It sounds like you'd be in a really good spot for actually doing Airbnb
So you'll see a hundred dollars charge
So if you can't commit to the 6:00 AM tomorrow, then maybe let's work something else out
So I'm gonna be looking for vacant properties that are really beautiful and I don't have to fix up.
It's something you've always wanted to do, sounds like
What about for Wednesday? What do we have going on? Anything? I haven't, Nothing
Well, honestly I just like to take it as it comes
So I'm looking for other things to do that will make me equal or more money, but I could spend with that time
Well no, I had already owned them. And you had already owned them? Yeah. Yeah.
So I'll probably take social security, I'll be 64 this summer
I would think you might get two or three months spread out through the year to have that happen here
And so I'm gonna go ahead
And then just you can let me know either way
It's just so the executive seller can help you on the call
Do you know what your credit score is at?
The way that would have to work out
Cause I know he's working kind from this Tuesday he will be off that
I'll send that over to you right after this and hope you have an awesome rest of your day
So I can do next Saturday, I can do next Sunday, I can do next Monday
And especially in the Atlanta area, it sounds like there could be some amazing properties around where you are <affirmative>, which you're very fortunate
I'm fantastic, thank you. Thanks for asking. I'm just trying to change the world.
Let me just ask you this, do you have a decent credit score or where are you at with that?
Like a six. What's your annual income?
Okay. Yeah, absolutely. I have to up your call. Yeah, <affirmative>. So no problem. Okay. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>,
Eem, I mean I look at the email but LS bf,
Cause you don't have to actually purchase a mortgage or go through lending companies and stuff like that
Well the long term I really wanna Rolls Royce, but that's like my dream car right now
Me. Okay, cool. And to confirm before I lock in here, a hundred percent, three 30 Mountain standard time, you can make that.
So we actually listed that one first
And I'd hate if you'd ever have to pay that
Now, obviously, if that's the case, well then that does require a higher level of investment
Five 30, we have a call with, What'd you say that guy's name is? Mike
Yeah, and at this point we've had over 10,000 people purchase the course
If you're not able to show up to the call completely focused, just randomly cancel or nohow is really what it's for
We found most people didn't take action or even if they did, they're not getting as much out of it
Wow, that's amazing how it worked out. That's awesome.
What do you wanna do? Am I gonna
Only reason I ask is the video is super important to make sure you take the most advantage of your time with him
I'll go ahead and lock it in
My real last name or just my, Yeah you can just use best. B E S T
So first thing to look at when you're going to get at least is typically credit scores. So ballpark range, what's your credit score right now?
So it'll be a phone call, you'll get an email, just a calendar confirmation and the actual call will be conducted over the phone.
You know what I'm saying? So with you actually doing that for me, I appreciate it
Thank you. You did the same. Bye now.
Okay, yeah, I don't wanna take up too much of your time man
Cool. And then I've got Dr. Booth 27 gmail.com. Is that a good email for you?
The 14th has some morning space before 12 o'clock on Tuesday the 14th, there's there is a space in there.
Yeah, so I put in many, many, many hours currently and that would allow me to not have to do quite as many hours.
And definitely a huge thanks to Brian as a result of that
Probably, yeah. I don't see why not.
Think's been an obstacle or what's something that's stopping you from getting closer to that $40,000 a month mark?
Fun to work for 10 hours or 20
But he's on track to net 2 million in his second year and he already has 80 properties
The residual income and something I can replace my job with. And then your future?
So I just wanna make sure that before we lock you in that you're a hundred percent good to go for that
So I could afford to spend more time with flexibility of, put more energy into it
I'll keep that in the back of my mind
That's fair enough. Actually say that my step in life is not determined by another person.
The charge that's just for no completely no showing or something like that
But I'm gonna go ahead and she's our head of customer support
Lisa? Well each of us I'd say we spend 10 to 15 hours a week probably
That doesn't really make sense to me whatsoever
Okay, why am I having to put a deposit down?
Quite a few. Do you know? Okay. Do you know what kind of limits you're working with or maybe available credit?
So Sean I know you got stuff that your family was talking about so we'll wrap this up
Well it was great talking to you
Understood. And are you renting right now or you just wanna upgrade house wise?
And I'd hate for you after I have to pay that
150 million users, 150 million users on Airbnb now
Everybody wants a pile of goddamn gold
No long as I have it on my calendar, which I do and I don't have, unless something unexpected like an emergency
No, she's in Arizona. That's where we are right now.
Can you change that to harm dale? Harmony property management group.com.
And so if you got there to 4k, I mean, would you just stop there completely or keep going?
Sometimes we have a wife and a business partner
I'm getting 12 something a month and sometime I can make a little hustle on the side doing a little driving
I guess I believe it based off of the studies I had done
If I want anything I will fund it
If it works, then I'm willing to invest more
And we'll get about one new property every 45 days and the average property, and that's about $2,000 per month
If I text this video over to you after a call, could you commit to watching it?
So just to make sure I have it correct, fully paid for manufactured home black California, currently vacant
So yeah, it's not, It's like it's under 600, it's like 5 70, 5 80
Well I'll be in Kentucky tomorrow so I think it's the same time zone
<affirmative>, I love it. Start building up, investing, investing more Airbnbs,
So I do have a couple spots that are open tomorrow. What does you and your wife's schedule look like tomorrow?
I need data. You know what I mean? I need the proof before I go doing something like that.
Where do you live right now?
It's kind of a big reason why I'm actually reaching out
So it's actually been a blessing in that regard
I haven't explored the newest side of things, but natural living part of it I love
Yeah, right now I do. Cause like I said, right now we're in the process of moving and things like that right now.
Yeah, just hang on as I log in, I'm trying to log into my email so I can get complete this Google calendar.
We're gonna bring sand in for a beach and we already have a pontoon to go with it
So here's what I'm gonna do for you, dude
I'm excited man. Yeah, that sounds good.
That's like what I would do with any extra money that I always had
So Lorenzo, I'm gonna send over a calendar invite to Lorenzo Lorenzo under space cook att
Cause you see them how it is, it's difficult
Yes. Hold on one second. You said it's gonna be an email
That'd be nice. I wouldn't complain to be honest. That'd be pretty nice.
Sure, bro. The success stories, they're always gonna be at the beginning of
Let you said the call is an hour?
Oh, well honestly, man, you're Congratulations cuz you're normal
That book, have that book started at all, so Yeah, no doubt.
Yeah, it's probably around 700 right now just because I, I've only had two year work
Cause I was looking at this other short term rental program, man
And we're not very materialistic people
It'll give you a great refresher, super good information there
So I buy something I'm like know it's interesting, buy it
Okay, let me see here. One second. Let me
What does your Wednesday this week look like?
Yeah, I may have purchased something like that I guess a while back
And so I have a particular passion around helping teenagers have an I can do attitude and helping young people start their business
And then I will follow up with you
And then, yeah, I was offered the $1,899 tax man that could do my taxes for me
And yeah, it's, I'm leaving every few days
If you didn't have any boundaries, what's the ideal monthly income you'd be hoping to get to with Airbnb?
Yeah, yeah, I'd be happy to hear more about it.
Oh yeah, no problem. No problem. Definitely. All
So of course, So you're in central time
Great. So Chad, what's your credit score?
<affirmative> what time did you say?
A bit more stuff that's not necessarily at Airbnb but that's one of our parent companies
All right. Lsb F G P gmail.com.
If I can set that up for you and wave the fee and do it for you free of charge
Learning, somewhat trading, but that's something that I would always be open for eventually
You Thomas. All right. What's going on? I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Going pretty deal pretty good. So that shit was gonna do better.
Getting them to that step right before they can be employed and make sure they have everything they need
So I think, I'm pretty sure I might have to cancel
So let me see what I got here
Rogers has what he needs to help figure out what kind of leases you can get approved for mind
And you just said that you just need the right guidance
All right, looks like it went through
Is there any chance to be able to make that <affirmative>? Yeah,
Okay, we're getting you finalized right now
But they kind of run their own, these guys order, they do everything
Yep. Should be coming through. Any second here.
I'm currently trying to get out of debt
Okay. Okay. So with a hundred dollars, what about that specifically makes not wanna do it? Do you intend showing up to the call?
Is that something you'd wanna do?
And now are these all ranting from someone else?
And then Bev is b e v like beverage
For sure. So I mean what would change for you if you had unlimited free time?
A five 30 tomorrow would be better. Yeah.
And take this trip to Disneyland and go to Dubai and just have some wonderful memories with them
Actually, to be honest with you, I've never even rented a Airbnb. I've never done this before.
Alrighty, let's see. You said one or at two o'clock?
Hopefully we can get some fur questions
Funk has the context that she needs just to help kind of figure out what you can get
Awesome. So first question is, what's your credit score?
That is the email that you wanna go ahead and click on
Like I said, I got rental properties, so it's rental properties are okay, but they can be a pain too
I'm sorry, you're cutting off man. You're a little choppy but I can hear, make up some words you're saying.
I'll have her send this out
So it sounds like you got a lot going on right now between your different ventures at your traveling
So is there any reason at all why you wouldn't be able to make that call?
Well, I see here it says Kim. Kim Copus
I'm talking to you on the car phone
Yeah, so awesome man. Cool brother. Well hey, did you ever get started with Airbnb or what's going on?
Would like a 4:00 PM or a 10:00 AM work for you?
Yahoo. Perfect. I'll send everything to there and get over, sent over and locked in. Okay,
I was just talking to a psychologist earlier today
Well I haven't seen a lot of the country I, I've seen, I've been to California two or three times but limited visuals
All right. And you'll be able to forward everything to your wife?
Just the one about a thousand and then the other one about 2000 for the month of December.
Yeah, that's fair. So it sounds like you still need a clear path to get there.
Central? Yeah, I live in Houston.
As I mentioned, so yeah, that doesn't work for me.
And I thought just a really all around perfect business idea if you wanna start without owning property
I know it's the first time I'm reaching out
Six 50 and up. I have three of them. Which one do you guys run TransUnion equal facts or experience?
Okay. Oh seven. And what is your gross annual income, like the number you'd be able to verify with a tax return from last year?
So he is fully aware, like a spouse or a partner?
Catherine Funk needs to figure out what's best for you
And so the reason you were interested in Airbnb is cause you solid
How long have you been working for?
Say schedule this meeting was easy, right? So you want people to schedule the meeting, you start now?
Oh, okay. It'd be 10. I could set the time if I Good.
You can get one down in San Diego, you can get one somewhere else
Second year I sold 47 and last year I sold 91
That's literally like $192,000 a year after the first year just working two to three hours per week
But I do have a resort that I'm part of already as Airbnb
Totally, totally, totally. Just curious, what was your goal getting Airbnb, your
So Blithe, So the second one is it's already has a renter in there that's a condo and Blythe
And so I think I may have used that a little bit outta context and not the
Right now? I mean I'm a consultant naturally that's how I make my money
If you recall, you ordered Brian's book a few weeks ago and had to start a Airbnb business become finished independent with it
Have you ever read audio and read the book at the same time? Have you ever done that?
So I'll go ahead and get you logged in for that time
Yeah, I, I've gone on the, Is
Oh, so there was a typo in here, that's why. So Leer and then the number four spelled out@gmail.com. Is that it?
They came over here and they started their own with the Donis company and they basically, I mean, started to swamp up properties
And then that has basically creates this amazing reputation for the company and brings in more students
So I'd rather just have this going on and just live my life on my own terms
We spent, Sorry, just to clarify, you spent $8,000 with Brian?
Well, I mean, it sounds like for you getting extra 20, $30,000 a month isn't necessarily just about making more money
I'll send that to you as well. Okay.
We were unable to save ahead of time and so we don't have a nest egg
I haven't had to pick up a phone in probably over a year to grab a unit
Sure, Especially once we get the first property going
So that's not how it's been going. <laugh>.
Actually why it's really the hot market.
And I lower it to where I can pay all of my expenses as well as the rent
Okay, so it's been a while. And is that kinda how your schedule's looked over the past 18, 20 years?
Stratton, so he can best prepare for your call and then put together a little preparation work
So inheritance a couple properties and then I have my income is probably about 1500 a month right now
And that's verifiable by taxes and stuff like that that you did last year?
Yeah, so it seems like you guys are just finishing up the final touches on the house
I really, I was hoping my husband can really help me get more involved with the bmp
Yeah, I think that that's actually how Brian started
I didn't hear you. I'm sorry.
All right, Brian. Sounds good. We'll talk to you later. Have a good night.
But definitely some of the key things were the smart locks with the wifi
Right. Have you wanted to retire your wife for a while?
For what? Oh, getting the flat fixed.
Okay. <affirmative>, do you have a specific number of properties in mind you wanna hit say a year from now?
And then you said you're paying a 1450 in Rent <affirmative> hundred, that's about $3,000 a month that you'd be looking at
<laugh>. Good thing we caught that.
It's trying to find a niche that works for me
That's like four jumbo jet line that's dropping out the sky every day
Gross, right? Yeah. Or, okay. 42. 42,000.
Yeah, for sure. Has that car collecting hobby viewers, that always been something that's been a big thing for you?
But yeah, a couple thousand, no problem
And I mean we would just grow and bring it back to the community, create jobs build a fucking badass team
On all of them? It got in depth a little bit. So I'll say about 16th out over
We'll get you set up and we'll get you some help here
And yeah, that makes total sense and I totally get that mean
5,000. Okay. My available credit right now sounds good, is probably 3000, but there's a $5,000 limit on it.
Yeah, we'll do yeah, I will
Absolutely. Right. You think, I mean, for you, where do you think the drive to wanna help your comes from?
Sometimes people live paycheck to paycheck or over that to where they're short of fun
I mean I think that's what anybody would want
Help with my what you call that, The slimness and kinda
Not necessarily more of that. My family does for the most part. They all do pretty good. They all have their own businesses and stuff.
So there's definitely still stuff you can do right now in terms of getting prepared
So do you have a quick second?
Cause honestly my favorite part of the job here is just hearing what people's goals are and hearing division and what they wanna achieve
Three to five years. So why so long?
So, okay, so basically if you did that, you basically, well I mean you wouldn't earn anything for the week, right? Kind of
So I'd be curious for you, Josh what made you feel excited about Airbnb in the first place?
And that was not even the only year
Awesome J And just one last important thing before your call, would you, I'm just gonna send over a quick few minute video
And the reason they do that is to make sure it's someone who can pay the rent on the property
But it all depends on how I did far as trucking
So right now, Douglas, it sounds like it was just the follow through for Airbnb and the accountability
Can you commit to watching that? Oh, I
So I gotta take a look at the calendar here first, but how's that sound so far?
He's netting like 25,000 bucks a month
But for you spending more time with your family mean, why is that important to you?
That's heck man, if you can help them out, go for it
We'll lock in at a 10.
I'm there, yeah. Do you wanna do something Tuesday or Wednesday?
So yeah, this number would be appropriate number to text me out, this is my work line
Not really. I'm sorry. Can you remind me?
Now going back to this 11:00 AM tomorrow Pacific time, Wanna make sure a hundred percent
Okay, cool man. Well what time zone you and John
You can partner with landlords. I mean
Well I know usually people don't purchase a course on Airbnb unless there's a specific result they're looking to get to
And then final thing anytime that I do schedule a call from Mr
Yeah, definitely. You think you'd spend a lot more time with family?
And then Christine, I just love it if you could send me a text after your conversation and let me know how it goes
I don't know what my commission is
So actually one o'clock looks like it might work
Yeah. So you're asking me for my credit card?
I plan to use that money towards maybe even Airbnb routes and stuff like that down the road
And these are properties that you own?
But you guys are good to go for tomorrow
We can figure out a time that works in your schedule
So that's the closest I've come to somebody with experience in Airbnb
Property management group.com? Yes, I can change that right now. Some of the longest email addresses I've ever seen. <laugh>.
I had a lot of relatives go and get a place Airbnb at there
Yeah. So tomorrow my latest is a five 30, would that
So I just want to see if it's, I definitely wanna know the cost
So yeah, what maybe interested in it and kind of made me wanna buy your book or not buy it, but
You'd love to get to 20
I have to keep some money for to keep running
And then you said you're basically looking for another job the past few weeks
And I got the book right before Covid hit and then it seemed like everybody stopped traveling
Let's do four to five tomorrow.
I don't wanna force you on anything
Right. Yep. And then do you have any credit cards?
I can tell 'em right away
<affirmative>, Get those toes in the sand
You're absolutely right. I mean that's a month in. What would you do with that income?
It'd be great to have a property and a different continent or something
Thank you so much. Bye bye.
I don't have a dollar amount in my mind
I think it's because I think that would replace my husband's income
Will you tell me what times you have available?
Well, I had it paid for, I didn't have a mortgage on it.
There's just a lot of places
But you have some credit that is available
We really did see this is a really something to do
And to be completely honest with you, man, I think we probably covered more valuable information in just the short call we had
We'll just move some things around to be able to fit that in
Yeah, I'm thinking about in the next week. I can give it more of it, more of attention. I'm wait to pop it out.
Show my email you're sending it to.
So if that's not the case, I'd rather just give this opportunity to someone else
