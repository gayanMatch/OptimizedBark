So in a perfect world, no boundaries, what's that ideal monthly income that you'd be hoping to get outta an Airbnb business?
But in my fico I don't really remember what those are
Brian Page. Let me look up the email.
I just not pulled into a truck stop
I mean I already pay somebody $20,000 a year to guide me in the right direction and just started working with him
We're here to nervous, answer some questions and point you in the right direction
And so essentially we could do a call tomorrow at 1:00 PM or 6:00 PM Eastern, or we could do some time
We've actually got full-time executive consultants who are a lot more equipped at actually get new results than I am
Yeah, 100% I can make three 30.
<laugh>? Nothing right now. Cause I just got this truck three months ago, well two months ago and this truck was a good little down payment.
I just wanted to be fully transparent with you, make sure that you could make it
I don't, just don't believe it would work around here in my community
Partly because my schedule, because I do work, I just shared how much I work partly because of how much I work
Okay, great. And the city again was, what was it? Fox Row,
How you doing Casey? This is Cooper with Bmb formula on Brian Page's team
Yeah. I mean it sounds good, but I, How do you go about acquiring the properties and keeping them filled and all those things?
All right. Yeah, I just replied.
And not saying that that would even be something
And to hit the $10,000 a month, how long do you think it's gonna take?
Okay. Awesome, Jason. I appreciate it, man and I look forward to hearing how it goes.
<laugh>, like wow, I mean that would just be amazing getting to travel
So I'm doing some credit repair courses now and I was gonna use that to fund for the rent for my new
So if you can't show up to the call focused just randomly NoShow or cancel, it's something like that really
I hate for you to ever have to pay that
Exactly? Just that my husband not having to go to a more than a nine to five that he doesn't like
So I don't have much money but that's kind of the level that I have made
Okay. You sure? Are you sure you're able to move some things around and be good to go from 11 to noon?
And if you ever have anything come up and Kim as well, we get that emergencies in life happens
But being stuck on this boat
And the other one for four days was $2,000
On, I'm over here going, What's the email? You actually get things at
So no, we're actually our office we usually work at was closed for New Year's Day, like the day after the weekend
And it's just to protect against having blank space on our consults calendar
Six or nothing, man. Six or nothing.
There's some huge things in there that will be incredibly profitable for you down the line
And so it's kind of just changed my perspective on life in general
I get, it's a 2000 time slot I permitted and I'm not a person to go against my word. So there's that.
And everyone I talk to about it, their ears just perk up
Okay. Yeah. So right now sounds like is, I can hear it sounds like you have a little one in the background, is that
So just so that he's fully aware
Do either of those work for you?
So 1:00 PM Are you solid on that time?
Checking FICOs. It's like 7 0 1.
We're kind of doing this big push right now where we're trying to increase the average student success rate
I would just need to check the calendar and see if we can find something
So basically getting the furniture in the house, finding the right property and having the money to put in the properties.
So once I had the means, I gotcha
Well I'm sorry to hear that
My dad's a small contractor while his homes and stuff, but physical labor's getting to him and my body
So anyway, that things happen for a purpose
And Ryan, I wanna make sure that we get this locked in for you before some of these slots fill up
Yeah, yeah, that'd be great. Just
And so I have people in my organization that drive a better car than I do
Lancer and l a n c e r. I'll also text it over to you so you have it on the books.
Right? Yeah. And I mean specifically control, I mean, why is that? Why is that important to you?
I've seen the thing he did with Oh, who's got wrote 10 x
We do a lot of weekend stuff, ski trips and things like that
Yeah, definitely Monday between the window 11 and 2:11 AM and 2:00 PM Eastern time and we'll wide open
Usually folks wouldn't put in all that time and effort in unless there was a certain outcome they were looking to get
We found they're typically working about three to five hours a week and getting about one new property every 45 days
So I'm gonna send over a quick confirmation for the calendar invite to casa to cash aol
Yeah, I mean that's what I would want to make. Just to get started. Tell me your name again.
So that's the newer business I've been getting jump started for the last year and a half.
Would a 2:00 PM Eastern time be appropriate time for you tomorrow?
Well, to replace my business, I mean replace my regular job income, I'm meeting probably about $8,700 a month.
Sure. Right. I got a couple minutes left. Yeah,
And then when I take over the company, fucking try to multiply that by two or three
I gotcha. Well, I'm gonna put you with Mr. Jake
Only reason I ask is I know it's been a while since the book and the video is just super important
I want. That's awesome. Well, yeah, and if you wanna be good at golf, you gotta put in the time you
I can do that for you. No problem. Hey, so how's the one property going?
I can say it's probably right at a 6 0 5 or something like that
Well, that's the only other thing that they need
And that's just working three to five hours per week
Do you wanna pull up, wanna pull up your calendar for Tuesday and take a look at your schedule?
Is that the best email to send a calendar invite to you for?
Hey, this is Thomas with B Formula
And these guys are literally the best in the business
Horse brother. Enjoy yourself. Have a good one.
Okay, so you're on central time then?
But on Monday I know she wouldn't be available
Okay. Right. What do you do?
Well who wouldn't want $10,000 more a month?
So I own a property out in California and that's vacant right now
Sounds like you, man. How many hours you put in a week?
Hey, pretty good. How about yourself?
So what's the like of you breaking that appointment? They said, Well well let's just don't worry about us, let's just don't meet
I'll just put that down here
But we'll go ahead with 5:00 PM Friday right now
Thursdays. Thursday's good for me. The only time not three is 2:00 PM.
What time zone are you in?
There's always gonna be funerals and weddings and stuff
I understand it's on 20 minutes. That's not a problem.
Okay. And is that all cash? Is that investments?
You can forward it to your wife or you guys can just watch it together however that may be
Yeah, so he actually works even closer with Brian than I do
I have a Discover with the Apple card is 5,422
Whether that be in your case, collect cars or maybe some people want to travel or retire early and all sorts of fun stuff
Typically it's a thousand dollar time slot
I mean, that's pretty much kind of settled now, but it was tough for custody for a while
A, Yeah, just a little <affirmative>. Yeah, just a good habit to give a little push at the beginning until it becomes a habit.
So as soon as you are able to obtain that 20 to 30, you're gonna have 50 to 60 on your mind
These guys are like, they're amazing at what they do, honestly
I take care of my mom, so I mean, I'll give her some cash, so yeah, I can help her out a little more
I don't know how much we talking about
So what time zone are you at?
I'm sorry, can you say that again? This one was breaking up.
I can email that to you right after this
You said you're gonna text it to me?
Okay. Can you take down my business email?
40 to 60 minutes. I would plan on 60 just to be safe.
I want to be able to do what I want on my own terms
So we actually don't have the ability to book these out past like 48 hours in advance
Cause typically it is a thousand dollars time slot, just one to be fully transparent with you, make sure that you could make it
Hell, we even have people who are automating every single piece of the business so they're not even working on it
And it looks like we have you booked in with Mr
And then Funk as in funky <laugh>
You too, man. Thank you so much. Appreciate
How does two one o'clock. Okay. Is that on Wednesday one?
And so she might be willing to leave, but I don't know if that's the case
Yeah. Get a little Tarzan action going. Your Airbnb, a little treehouse or something like that. <laugh>.
So if it's 10 then then I'm already gonna be at what is that nine, I mean 903,009 nine, 9,300
It just depends on the day and the availability
So with that said, and on a scale of one to 10, you can be totally honest with me here
So at this point, landlords are talking, people are networking and the new deals are just kind of falling into your lap.
I gotta take a look at the calendar first. That sound
Course. You wanna take a running start at it, not just a dab, which is kind a lot of things going on
I do. I did buy it. Yep.
And then just a few more things here for Mr
Okay 10:00 AM We're we going? Definitely give it a shot. So 10:00 AM
No, I absolutely wanna do it. I absolutely wanna do it. I love some
Yeah, so I'll take a note and make sure I do that after this call
I'm cool to watch that and then we'll set up a time to chat with one of your guys
I can't hear you. Could you repeat that please? What time, what
<affirmative>? No, that's what both properties and that's just in the first three months. And so
Do you own the place you live in right now or do you own any property
I do. I'm not gonna put no cap on the Lord. If he says more, then I'm gonna get more <laugh>.
The condo was $2,000 for four days
Which is what I do now
Even if it's in stocks or crypto,
Didn't hear the last part. I think I have a super solid, I think I have a super solid idea of how I can help you.
I'll kind of give some context on this or on our call, he'll probably ask you a bunch more questions
Yeah. What's the format? Is it video chat or just telephone call or?
I would say between five and 10 minutes. If you could just set aside,
You're obviously just at the start here
Once I get a yes, boom, we move that sucker to get it live, bam, bam, bam, doing all the right things
And I've basically had to try and do it myself
Can you tell me what do you mean by that?
But how does all that sound?
Yeah, I work in a nuclear industries, remember
<laugh>. <laugh>. Wow. What would that mean to you, man, to be able to do that for your mom?
We've watched a lot of his stuff before
I gotta go out and improve myself
I generally have found that whenever I help other people it comes back to reward me in some way
Right now is time. I'm just haven't thought taking the opportunities at the moment. That's just where I'm at.
Well, if that's the case, yeah, I'm leaving my current job and yeah, I'll do whatever I want to do at that point. <laugh>,
Even if it's in stocks or crypto right now?
And I find that to be the hardest part
So whats say a business owner.
Okay. Right on. Another thing they're gonna look at there is credit score and verifiable income. So do you know what your credit score is at
It gives you some really good information
Let's see. Thursday morning is available up to 11, and then after four is open.
Yeah, absolutely. I'll be on that call at then.
I'm just gonna send you account invite after this that you can accept
Yeah, I'm okay with a Japanese car and that.
Currently I am working somewhere between 35 and 40 hours a week typically.
Your team. Well, we'll talk Friday. Okay.
So just a few more things before we wrap it up <affirmative>
Specifically? But I only have, well, number one, I'm not greedy
Especially with how condensed those things are for multiple months at a time
Able to do that? Yeah, I could take a break from what I'm working on to pay attention. It's just
Yeah, that's amazing that you're able to handle that right now
Do you have an income figure? A monthly pass, a monthly cash flow figure that you're hoping to get?
It's a 20 minute video you said?
He is gonna be taking care of you and part of Mr
Does that ring, Is it ring a bell?
Oh no, I was just trying to look up my information right
So that should be everything Mr
So that is all that Mr
With the intention of course of staging it with furniture and putting on Airbnb
But there's something definitely on the todo list right now
Would be me and my girlfriend Whitney. She's also interested in doing this with me for life. Okay.
I mean, I think maybe starting to get better now, but I was thinking I might revisit it after
Six I last time my check was in between the 6 32, the 6 47.
Getting your first property is the tipping point
Okay. And how many hours a day would you want to be working? Ideally if you could get everything figured out?
I feel like that's the starting point and then I can grow up my business
Yeah, but we can make the appointment in Eastern time
You would actually go around to landlords and property owners offered to rent their place from them
Life. <laugh> a very modest, Yeah, you're like a buck and a half a week there.
Would great forward. I would like it. Yeah.
And I can definitely maybe connect you
I just need to jot that down so he has some context of what you can get approved for
Her <laugh>. My name is Sunny
The market has gotten so crazy, the prices, they're all skyrocketed
And so the guy's gonna clear, I mean shoot, he's gonna clear 25 grand this month from his business
Yep. I was in Spokane. Yep.
So hopefully by then, I mean I would be able to jump into this full on with the BV formula
So I got a very long list of things, places that I wanna go very long
My email will come from Cooper page at bnb b Brian's team
So it's the way it fit is I know with Airbnb I don't have to focus too much on the property itself
It's gonna give you some background info on Airbnb and Brian Page and this whole sort of process
Cuz you'll put a massive smile on my face and that's what I love about this job
Okay, gotcha. Okay. And how far out are you from Sacramento?
So I mean that's actually a big reason why I'm calling
So typically landlords, there's a lot of reasons why they won't do it
I'm working on that as you speak to all my furniture and make sure everything is good with the house and all that
That'll get you the things that you want that would make you feel like you're closer to your ideal life.
Yeah, just go to gbo. You did you press a Google calendar already?
They say six grand. I saw the map on the call. Yeah, that's what they said.
All right Joe, well I appreciate you taking the time man
Okay. And you're in Pacific Time
I mean, to be honest with you, I just wanna see when I first saw the video, how he was doing it
Travel and mostly travel and just yeah, mostly do that and travel.
I made money off cryptos and different other stuff that I did as well, and my own business thrived throughout Covid
You don't ever have to actually go into the properties
I never got to the second person even
I have a credit card in my bank that I believe is, let's open it
So looks that the time is open
Yeah. And what do you do right now for work?
So just tired of working there, Tired of working online, hard labor, tired of it,
But there's another thing that I think about when I think about that
Could you go ahead and open that up and accept that really quick
Okay. Awesome. And what time zone are you in?
I don't need millions and millions
I think that this is gonna be a lot of fun and I think it's gonna work
No, in sales man, you gotta answer everything
So ultimately I do want to have more passive income
<affirmative>. And you still haven't gotten that first one yet and I totally get that
And Hawaii, that would be heck, that'd be the dream. Would you take other people with you too? Yeah.
Now obviously if that's the case, that would require a higher level of investment
And this is Airbnb I can tell you is not the get rich quick
Now everybody from Canada and stuff are going there
I mean, the guy's netting like 25,000 bucks a month,
Okay. And so I can just see if one of 'em has some time to hop on a call and help you out with this.
You talked about your kids a lot
Sherry, do you not think we're gonna refund your a hundred dollars?
So then in that case, I think we have spots three o'clock Pacific, but we do have Saturday slots open
Well question for you, how do you feel that growing your Airbnb business will help you get there?
be too soon? We definitely wanna make sure that you guys aren't like driving
But I don't know how to say it
So I mean anything else is a plus
Right. Yep. Well great. I'll send this stuff over to you right after this
That would be we could go on trips and go to places they want to go, not just to a house or something
I'll send over that calendar invite or actually already sent it over but we'll get you locked in there and I'll let Mr
But I mean that's some that I'm trying to have some type of income off of
Yeah, that's the goal. Get to resort
A lot of that stuff in there will be some review, but also some stuff you just go through that
If I can get that to you, like free of charge and waive that fee, is that something you'd wanna do?
I think this was early 2020 when I ordered this book, if I'm not mistaken
Yeah. I'm trying to get 10, 15 <laugh>.
Yeah, I'm ready. Yeah, we ready? It's just that time I'm ready too.
Gotcha. So you're about 6 32 to 6 47 credit 83 80 pounds, about 6,000 in capital.
So it's like, yeah, I love it man
It sounds like Airbnb could be a
Don't really looking to get in the market going, learning the steps of getting pre-approved and all that kind of stuff
Okay, my husband's a tax man so he should be able to find that information really easy.
The other one will say scheduled or you have an invitation to meet with Mr
Yeah, it can cause trouble sometimes.
Awesome. Did you have a good weekend?
Yeah. Your last name, is that how it's pronounced?
Nope, not bad, man. How's going on?
We found that yeah, you're right, it is a good idea
You can ask me if I don't think you're gonna send the money back
Yes. If I could learn how to do it and be successful with it, it would make a big difference.
At that point? More than likely I would make sure
<affirmative>, they're averaging 2000 a month on one property.
Okay. Absolutely. One 30 is perfect.
The only thing, like I said, right now I'm just waiting for the student to come in cause I just paid so many things
We don't have to figure it out
Okay, so you say Mountain Time, what did you say after that?
Yeah. Do you remember spending about a thousand bucks with us for BNB Formula course while back?
Well right now there's 150 million users on Airbnb and only 4 million hosts
Yeah. Yeah, that's another place I wanna visit to.
Well eight on Monday works for you as you know, obviously Matt's time is valuable and superior too
But just so you know, the way this works, just cuz we really wanna make sure our consultants' time's being protected it's super simple
Yeah. So what would you personally need to see for you to feel like this is gonna work for you?
Cause definitely seems like a great concept
I'm trying to get rid of clutter, not gather more clutter
Now are you a hundred percent sure that you can be seated down? No distractions
Central Eastern. Is that, Yeah, I think those are two different time zones. What state are you in right now? What city?
I don't have an employer <affirmative>
You didn't tell me about that. I've never heard someone say that.
Now we're talking Daniel. Now we're talking. Okay. Okay. Glad you have
Do you remember purchasing that a while back? The one that teaches you how to become financially independent on Airbnb without owning any property?
So <affirmative>, I have not made any traction, but I've definitely kept it in mind
I'm gonna send you some emails and I'm gonna send you a calendar invite as well and we'll lock this down for you
Like Brian talked about <affirmative>, residual home inspections I don't really make, that's my time
And Sherry, just so you know, the way this works, it's super simple
Platform, We're just making enough to get to cover the mortgage
And then, I mean how would your personal life change for you? How would your personal life change?
I mean we, we've had dozens of students who hit a 20 K month in just their first six months
Time to vacation, store money away, invest more money
So do you know what your credit score is right now last time you checked
Checked in. Gotcha. And then also a ballpark here, but what's your current annual income
Thanks be to God when I go to bed at night, I don't have a headache, but I want to do more
So just to keep expanding just because mm-hmm
Okay, great. And is your best email cody coon one gmail.com?
Yeah, I know people get busy or people just, I can probably, I chose not to do it
But the few that did really did incredible
And I'll put you with Mr
And do you feel like going in Airbnb business to be very successful is something that's going to help you get there?
Yeah, I'll check. So it looks like harra, so just your last name then? 0 7 0 3 icloud.com
I have a friend. I have a friend who's also an entrepreneur I'm close with.
Yeah, especially in Florida as well
So I mean, let's say you did that, right? You reinvest and then you know reinvest again and then you reinvest again
Oh yeah, I'm definitely still working my way towards that
Yeah, I was really excited and I dunno what happened, but I was
I was just gonna say, because you're kind of new to the whole Airbnb business, it's something you've kind of been teetering about
You gotta get through the, even though you learn from other people, you gotta learn yourself
And I mean for you, I know you got some other businesses
One has a tenant in there
Click yes. And I'm not sure if you've gotten it. Yeah.
And how's that been affecting the way you guys live?
I mean, does sense, do you understand how those numbers work?
It might have gone up a little bit
I actually build houses I do construction and then I also own a trucking company
Not that that's been, And that's one thing
<laugh>? Yes. Is Insight jcl your best? Email aol.com.
So I'm gonna send you over a counter invite really quick to Theresa, so you could there Davis yahoo
And that two, $3,000 a week you said is that you're doing that in profit?
I'd like to get some, I would like to have a conversation with them and everything
That was a hell of a year, was it not?
Yeah, I'll be there. It'll be, It'll be at 10. Okay. Trust me, I'll be
So I just didn't know if any of that applied to you
Like I said, it's about 30 minutes long
Man, I was I all into it
Not paying any interest out for anything here pretty soon, right? Yeah
Yeah, my spouse. She's the one that is the one who cleans it and talks to the people and she runs it. Yeah.
Well hey Mitchell, I'm reaching out man
Yeah, exactly. An ebook <affirmative>. Remember that?
Anyway, yeah, good talking to you Thomas
Were a lot more equipped to actually get new results, get me started than I would be
Capitals. Yes. K o p o u L.
So our executive consultant has the context that they need to guide you in the right direction for getting started with Airbnbs
So if you extrapolate that out within 90 days you'd be at your second property and you'd be cashing $3,000 per month
Now question for you here, Michael
Episode, so sorry about that. She's cool. What kinda bird is that?
Okay. What do you do right now for work?
And we'd hate for you to ever have to pay that
I know you're excited for this and you got the schedule, so just wanted to let you know cuz you're serious about it
You're the smartest person in the world
She brings about the same as me.
Well then let's do it for you
Probably how many hours we spend in a week do you think Lisa? We got the two properties
So that was a big consideration on it if I started here
No, actually I'm very busy this week. Whole week I think. I don't even know tomorrow I have time. Okay. I got <inaudible>. So
My client me only reason why is if my client go goes over, so we should be done at about four 30
Huh? Well, you know what, Cooper, that that's something that I don't know about that man
Okay, gotcha. Yep. And why five to 8,000? Anything with that specifically?
All right, thanks David. Bye bye. All right, bye.
I was just interested in learning about that, about the process and just hearing more
But out of the people that were able to get started, they had incredible success
I mean honestly I have a business to run so I tie up a lot of my capital that way mean maybe around five.
Is that something that you'd wanna do?
I mean for you it's really more about just having that freedom my time to not have to Yeah,
Well I'm gonna say a 10 and I'm hoping that you can find this would be better
When you're passionate about something, it doesn't feel like work
I can get you on as soon as this afternoon
So I'll go ahead and lock in that time for you
I only one or two properties to start getting 2000 a month
Awesome. I'm gonna send over a calendar invite right now. Could you just open it up and accept it really quick?
If that's the case, I can give this opportunity to someone else
So when you receive money training that costs a lot
Yeah, so you know what I'll do, I'll be ready, do the conversation in my car and I'll, I'll be focused in with the notepad
Well, you arrive in San Francisco by the afternoon or the evening.
I have not gone there yet.
So that's what I do for work
Yeah. So our executive consultant will call you just on the phone number we're talking on right now.
With you and then it's one
Yeah. And so at this point right now with the income you're making, are you able to outsource that stuff yet and offload it?
Five years. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. How I mean much longer you planning on staying there?
So now that I'm a mother, I want to ensure the same for my kids
Is that kind of more of a comfortable number?
Yes, I did. And I got some of those things back in your Probably supposedly gave me a thousand dollars
I feel like once you start something, it's easy to keep it going
Basically we have to share with everybody else and if it's not anything towards what we're doing, we don't usually get it went out.
But I wanted, usually people don't d and b I wanted to do rentals. And I don't see Brian Page anymore for that. What's going on?
That would probably be the best one to use.
Yeah, so I can access your
So I did get that book
You too, man. And happy Thanksgiving, we don't talk to you again.
Do you want me to share it?
And then people sort of traveling again and people never really stop traveling
We were just skiing, so really snowy.
And then I have here in our system, looks like you're in East Troy, Wisconsin
People up here aren't really open to new business ideas
So I was just on the calendar and we had 10:00 AM open and it just kicked me back in air message
They actually have to do more with how the person thinks and the specific mental models that they operate with towards their Airbnb business
That does make a lot of sense to me
So if you were making $20,000 a month from Airbnb, would you wanna take a couple steps back from the trucking business?
But is there a true method of, how do I wanna ask this? Asking without asking for a guaranteed yes, if that makes sense
Is that per week or per day?
It doesn't make sense because our world is geared towards providing everything, every human needs in the whole world
You mentioned earlier you said 3,600 a month to replace you full-time income. Is that where it's at right now?
Hey, Dan. It's Cooper, Yeah, with BMV Formula. I'm Brian Page's team. How you doing?
If you're not able to show up to the call focus, you just randomly cancel or no-show something like that
And so you're interested in Airbnb
Well I can't say I can do it alone
Flat. Well, that's good to hear, man, that you're back home.
It would just say B and b refundable, deposit a hundred dollars
And you came from nothing, it sounds like, and you're just like,
So the first question is, do you just know what your credit score is at last time you checked?
Just where I would be okay with it
Okay. And why not of 10?
We go ahead and process that right now
So I'm supposed to, your booking is confirmed
There would be some instances where I would give back, especially since I am already in a ag based company where we supply food
And so there's one last thing we're required to do is fill out this little form
Okay, understood. And then Detroit is also in Eastern time, so is there a time at all tomorrow that you'd be available?
6:00 AM or noon. If you can't get ahold of me at 12, talk with somebody at lunch or something like that so I can,
Hey Jalen, this is Thomas with b B Formula. Do you remember ordering Brian Page's book on Airbnbs about two and a half months ago?
Did you say that? Did I hear that correctly?
Okay. Okay we will. We'll do it here. So you're in Pacific time?
I still drive the same car I've had for years and not that I don't make a lot of money per month, I do
What we can do is, it looks like I see a check mark on our side in terms of tech, tech confirmation
But sounds like you're available Monday at three, so it shouldn't be an issue for you
I think we're in a very kind of unique time right now because of us
I cannot do tomorrow. It's 11. I cannot tomorrow. So
So I, What would you do if you had an extra 20 to $30,000 a month coming in from Airbnb?
Yeah, cause I'm traveling all the time right now, so it'd be nice to not to have to.
Having that opportunity to be able to invest just with everything
People will really, I'm in Buffalo, New York by the way
Tyler. Hey Tyler. Hey, this is Cooper with B B Formula. I'm Brian Page's team. How you doing?
No worries. I got a five or a five 30 Eastern time tomorrow. Which one would work better for you?
If 1:00 PM on Wednesday works for you, let's schedule you in for that time
Okay. I could do a three o'clock Eastern on Thursday,
Edward, that should be about everything we need here
So basically you have some context around this call
Yeah, let's go. I believe in you, man. I think you can do it. I truly believe you can.
Wow, that's awesome. So to get this property give a set income goal you want for this property to produce?
Well I just texted it to you and I'm gonna send it to Fumi a i n a. So your last name@hotmail.com.
And then the more that you hoard, the more that you build up and invest it just creates more security, right.
Oh okay. That's awesome. So essentially replace your full-time income possibly so that you can spend more time at home.
So on our team, far above me, light years ahead of me, we have full-time executive consultants
So always wanna make sure that we're helping anyone that needs to be helped
So Brian and Page wrote the Bmb formula book, which teaches you how to become financially independent on Airbnb
Well, it's in a trust right now, so I mean, I don't know what exactly we're gonna do with it
I think they could. Yeah. I believe that <affirmative>, I think they could have a lot more or they need a lot more.
The first part, yeah. The second part. With a long term perspective though,
I have no idea why, how that your bookwork I can lend before I jump.
<affirmative>. Exactly. So you feel like you would personally feel a lot better by doing things for folks around you, enriching their lives,
Yeah. How long is it before your deployment finishes?
So yeah, that's kind of what I was looking at it and just trying to get info on it
Just like to make extra income.
It's anywhere between seven 50 and seven 80.
Would you just want to do that?
But can you definitely commit to me to watching that whole thing before tomorrow, or at least before the call it too?
Cause what works for one person won't work for the next
So with that being said, it is one of our goals to help people
Now, I mean, I'd have to take a look at the calendar first, see if there's something I could do for you
I, so I, I don't even know how to explain what I do
I know what we can do
Well see, here's the interesting thing about that
But I gotta see my wife's father has a place in Barbados, so that'd be cool to get a one or two places there
And most people that went through the book never had any success
So how many, between the two jobs you do in security construction how many hours a week are you working?
I mean, where are you at now?
So I know you have the intentions
So you're on that list so I can definitely get that to you
And you're feel like right now with your w2, you're rather limited on that?
Maybe I get enjoy time with my sons, my wife
I am open to hearing about this one hour call and seeing what is offered at the end
That should be plenty of time to get a place, get to the place where it's automated enough
So that's literally $150,000 a year in just the one year putting about two to three hours a week
No, like I said, I get it, man
I mean, I'd probably say most weeks it's at least 60
You there? Hey Matt? Yeah, this is, Hey, this is Cooper with BNB formula, Brian Pages team, how you doing?
For a consulting to be able to speak with someone for an hour about
And so just like ballpark range, what's your credit score right now
I feel like being a person who have Airbnbs, you make money in your sleep doing that
Do you remember ordering Brian Page's book on how to start an Airbnb business about two and a half months ago?
I'll go ahead and lock it in here and send you over all the info
And this is my work number, but I'm gonna go ahead and send you over my cell phone number after this.
I thought I could come here
I'm just curious, what got you interested in Airbnbs in the first place?
If you don't, I mean you can decide to negotiate for a longer lease
I have my real estate license, so I have a couple of clients but I don't do a whole lot with it
Sounds good. Yeah, I'll spend the time, see where it goes and how it comes out.
Thinking that it can work? I mean I've done selling before
Course to do a couple more things
Noah bin Wa, he's actually, he's awesome
Yeah, that's what I, so that's the one that I just selected to add to my calendar. Is there another one I need to accept
Sounds like maybe there's some travel you guys want to do and things of that nature
I hosted their whole not the whole funeral, but some days they came over to eat and whatever and whatnot
And the more individualized, the more one on one, the increase in price, right?
Just wouldn't wanna leave her out
I'm just thinking about Disabled and Foster
Yeah, let me ask, he's gonna net like $25,000 a month. This he's gonna net $25,000 a month this month from that.
I ain't gotta do hammers and nails
I think Kentucky might be in the same time zone.
So what got you interested in Airbnbs in the first place?
Right. Well, could you commit, maybe find an extra two to five hours per week?
And with that being said, please be sure to do whatever you need to do
I say got a chance, I guess I could read it at night, but No,
Even <affirmative> and then we should be doing this simultaneously
Now? Oh yeah. Yes. I think it should be good on our side. It looks like it looks it is good.
It's like the general one I know
But like I said, anywhere between five to 8,000 a month I'd be good with
HR department, okay. You sound like you're the people person, type of person. You're that people for you
I don't know if we're talking per week. I think an hour or two Monday through Friday probably.
What about that's important to you?
Well, we're hoping January is what we hope it's, it's gonna be really nice, the four bedroom, it's gonna be really nice
So what do you, Sorry, I'm just getting in the truck
And we're just doing that until the end of the next week
Okay. Is traveling a passion of yours?
She's always just trying to make sure that she's helping anyone that needs to be helped
But that's what we got going on with the pandemic
<affirmative>, I'm just gonna send you over a calendar invite to that really quick
That should be enough to get you in a few properties to start with
Food to live every day. How
So every way which way I look at it, I don't win when it comes to figuring out how to grow a business
And also I wanna know if there are any coaching involved
And so for you, getting to $2,000 a month is something that you could do with potentially your first property
Oh, well yeah, now that I took this night job I have it's at around 40 now.
I have a pretty decent portfolio currently, so
Okay, well here's what I can do
I wanna be big at it
So I, I'm gonna ahead and pass on this cause I don't want to commit to something then I'm not able to commit
I like realistically, this is a cool idea
Not with Matt, but let's see what I have for tomorrow on Central
So I'm gonna send over a calendar invite to that email right now
I actually work with Brian Page
No, hundred and 40 something and something around there.
Thank you so much. And what was your name again?
Last 15 minutes, but I'm going to be there
Okay. What do you need more money for?
And he said that outside of firs about hours week
Well seriously, I appreciate Yeah, that's good
But that should be everything Mr
And then so maybe a thousand or two available capital, that deal comes through credit score is 400 incomes about three K month
Yeah, no, that's a great question
Hey, it's Thomas with BBB Formula from Brian Pats team. How you doing?
Give about 20 seconds here and I'll get you confirmed in for that time slot.
You can get started with some capital saved up, whether that be checkings and savings or maybe credit cards
Yeah, no, I mean I've been wanting to get started on this
And you're going to send my login information for the educational materials?
I do DoorDash or Uber Eats, so I'm on my own schedule <affirmative>
Between us both, we at least think that, I think maybe even more
And well, I am super excited to see how our conversation go with Daniel
Okay. I was gonna say, I'm only gonna lock this in at a 10.
And then you say they cut their hours into 10 hours,
Like I said, I'm always willing to learn and gather more information so I can do better at what I'm doing
You can a hundred percent make that
That's what Brian's kind of given me the assignment of doing
But we found that the few people that did, they went through and they were like, I'm doing it
Okay. Yeah, we could definitely do that. But if the numbers, I'd love to kind of dive into that.
You know what I mean? <affirmative>
Awesome dude, I'm gonna see if we can get you confirmed here
Dude. How many hours are you working a week?
I'm just here on the student success team
Exactly passive case you're gonna be putting in work for it
He just got his 14th property and he's gonna net 25 K this month
More of it, I feel like, adds more confidence Totally
Yeah, that sounds right. That sounds okay.
Yep. Cool. Let's see what we can do for you. Which times aren you in
I want to, it's definitely above 700, just don't know where
I mean, I skimmed through it, which was awesome
I'll give you a call on Friday and then the schedule will be open for next week and we can get you in
Okay, I understand that. Where are most of the properties located would you say? Or is it usually people do it near
And so I'm excited for you man, and excited to see how it goes
Do? What would I do with it? Shit
Yeah, I would probably invest in more cars
I wish I can qualify for more property
So it wouldn't necessarily be a partner, it would just more or less be just an acquaintance I'm talking to, if that makes sense
Highest ones? And Amex? It's like eight grand.
My goal, my, well, I want to make a $10,000 a month or do more.
So they ran through some just the bad experiences that just put a bad feeling in their mind
I was just trying to pretty much level the playing field to see what it was
I'll shoot you a calendar invite right after this
I don't really have an actual number, but for now my initial number would be cool to see
So I mean, typically they charge a thousand dollars for their consulting
It'd be Mississippi, but yes, I mean currently I'm in Ohio
It seemed like I saw a presentation and it seemed really a really good opportunity
But it was a good book
Yeah, yeah, you could totally just watch it now
So it would have to be like after, Let me look at my
So I'll discuss it with her
This takes about 20 to 30 minutes
Okay. And so do you believe that that God basically is sovereign over the world and that he will do what's best You?
I should have just sold it and made 35 or 40 on it
I could definitely lock that in for you
Go to that email and I'll watch it and we'll talk on Monday. And you have
I live pretty close to St
Awesome. And where will you be at that time by the way?
Gotcha. Are you a truck driver?
Like I said, honestly, I thought about it at that time
Wow. Out of, I'm guessing dozens of thousands of people who reached out and applied Right <laugh>,
So 11 times I was think my mortgage was like $1,700
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm excited for it
That's something I'm passionate about as well
That's always why I'm curious, I'm asking
Okay. So can both of you be on the call at eight 30 this evening?
Typically we only are able to actually book these about 48 hours in advance because we need to leave the schedule open for consultations
So anyway, I see it after the fact
This month we're looking to probably split four grand and then the summer month are gonna be good, so
But I've got some other resources that are far better than the book on the back end of this call potentially
For me, cause growing up I never had those choices.
I can if be in business, you shouldn't have anybody teaching it who hasn't done it themselves
Before I do that there's just a few questions to fill out
And you can truly do it way faster than that
Typically it is a thousand dollars time slot
Awesome. I'll send over that video and yeah, if you wanna finish the book too, even better.
Yeah, I think it's about seven 50 or something like that.
It's sort of like a cooperation together
10:00 AM Yeah, we can do 10:00 AM 10:00 AM will work.
Okay. Well, what would you do with some of the extra income if you had a little bit left over?
Even if I fall short of a million dollars a year, I'm still gonna be living pretty happily
We typically don't book these out farther than 48 hours, typically over the weekend
Oh no, there's no reason I'm on night shift
So got a couple off the next days possibility at all to work something in
And then the only other thing before the call is Mr
It's been a while since I've looked at the credit score but it was in the seven hundreds range last time I looked.
So there's potentially, you're talking about four to six family members that you're not close with now
Can't. That's the time I pick up my sons from school.
Okay. Well hey Tyler, tell me
Oh, you're in Scottsdale? Oh yeah, of course.
There's only a few amount of spots here and typically it's a thousand dollars time slot
Yeah. That can feel like whoa a little bit sometimes.
We just have fun and then life is a fucking game, man
That okay, now its a invitation. Okay, I do see that.
So doing the math on that $4,600 $4,600, Airbnb takes about 3% and you're doing that
It's not gonna get you where you want to go, is it?
He's already got 14 properties, <affirmative>, and the guy's going to be netting $25,000 this month from his portfolio
Maybe it's late 2019, early 2020, somewhere in between that time I ordered this
Oh yeah, I would just cause whether it might be in Eastern, you might be in whatever
But if you wanna set a early goal, 10,000 a month would be nice
I'll send you a calendar invite, send you over the pre-call video and we'll be good to go
Okay, so what I'm seeing, let's see
So that is a great question and I can point, Yeah, I mean being in business, stuff happens
Actually a link from the calendar software
And so I get you have a word on that that I will get you guys in 6:00 PM Eastern on Monday
You said how much was the
Nothing. I mean, it says retire fund but can't access that I guess.
Some people get the digital version, some people got the physical
Different types of income coming in.
No worries. And then what's your gross annual income at the number you'd be putting on your tax returns?
But here you can have five grands set aside and get started with your first place or you don't even have to have anything
Would you mind helping me fill it out really quick, Just a few questions? Sure
It's actually the first time that we've connected, but Brian wanted me to reach out
No. Did I actually purchase that?
Yeah. No, it's not a problem.
We've been updating our calendar recently, so we could do a 10 45 or 11:45 AM central time tomorrow
There's definitely some huge things in there that will be profitable for you down the line
Okay, awesome. I know I'm harping on it hard, I just, they're, they're pretty strict about it. I just wanted to triple check there cause
And I'd honestly hate for you to ever have to pay that
It would be a very great feeling not to have to be concerned about money, but
So would it be too much to ask for you to watch that video after this call? It's only 12 minutes long
So I clicked yes to accept I'm not sure if I need to do something else
Oh when I checked it probably last month
I'm almost debt free so I, I'm enjoying that thought quite a bit
And so my goal is to expand to other areas and then to also just continue to grow that revenue as much as possible
How long do you think it's just curious, cause earlier you mentioned that you, you're starting your own clothing brand
Yeah, you're right. Yeah, you're absolutely right. Do you have a couple places in mind
Yep. 30 K a month. Passive a hundred percent. Is that where you would get to wanna get to long term?
So you know, obviously can't expect that
And then, oh you gotta add in the maintenance fee
Cause you mentioned mortgage and credit stuff
Okay. I'm sorry, I'm terrible when I, What's your name again?
Oh yeah, for sure it does.
And that process should start with me, if that makes sense
So that should be just about everything that Mr
Can. Yeah, totally. What would that be like man, being able to have more time at home with your son?
Only reason I ask is the video is just super important
If I could just pull some strings back here
Well, yeah I'll get off shift at 10:00 AM tomorrow so after that.
And then just one less important thing
Yeah, giving my credit card information over the phone isn't secure for me, so
So I'm here to hook you up if I can shuffle some things around here
She is amazing what she does and she's definitely able to help you
So for you in a perfect world, didn't have any boundaries
Phenomenal to the point, direct quick Haven't started yet looking to do that
Awesome. Cool. Yeah, yeah, no easier for you, you know, can send it the email, you can send it text, whatever's faster,
Of course. You're welcome, man. Bye bye.
Well Donny, you're good to go with Mr
But yeah, I just kinda some clarity around that
Literally, yeah, just $120,000 a year just from a couple hours a week is what that would probably be looking,
So I'll be home at four
No, that's really, no, I'm glad you brought that up because that's something that that's super important to take into consideration
If you are not there to do it, it's not gonna happen
That's actually really important and good
I'd have to look up my tax return for that
Of course, man. Take care. You have a great rest of your evening.
Just so they can figure out what kind of leases that you can get approved for
Yeah, 3000 a month, that's like bare minimum obviously. Probably if you were making 10 K month, that'd be even better. Oh yeah. Oh man.
Is he gonna be able to make that call at so we said 2:00 PM on Saturday
So subtract them the probably paid them about $5,000 over the year
I've got about a 30 minute video that's actually far better information, clear and concise to the point
And part of the reason I'm calling today is to, cuz I'm allowed to hook you up with some free resources
Gotcha. That's cool. That'd be really cool.
Back. That was the year the pandemic hit 20. Yeah.
Talking to somebody that doing it and done it and pretty good at it, that should help you, that should motivate you
All I gotta do is find someone who I can automate almost anything that I want
Do you know what your credit score's at right now?
To 'em, unless they're probably update my address with you
What do you guys like to do mean? Would you guys travel or just quality time?
I already started a business in 2017
I think it may have a super solid idea of how we could help you
So that's kind of how I feel that cause it's not worth just chasing a bag so you can't enjoy it with other people
Whichever one's the best one for your calendar.
Give you an idea of, because I know you, you're saying you know dollars and that's totally attainable
Just cuz you got burned once
This is a serious opportunity for you, you're trying to jump in fired up
You too, my man. Take care. Bye.
Hey Brian, can you hear me?
It's really like damn near impossible to do it
Bonno, Just make sure that anyone I place on his calendar like this watches a very important pre-call video beforehand
On you in the only thing is,
And then you also determine if that is something that is something you want to do
Yourself for somebody you know, want them to be committed as you are.
I'm not really with discussing that kind of detail
That's actually a pretty solid point to start out with. As long as it's not like 400 then oh
Yeah, I read a little bit here and there
So if this is the only obstacle to me getting a ton of properties and making money, then that's not too bad
What kind of, I want them to say, Wow man, I can do that
Okay so let's see. Let's do this. So you're totally out ca a hundred percent commit to anything for Thursday or Friday.
Just basically trying to, at some point, do this to my house whenever we decide to move out.
Theoretically we should be back on Sunday
Typically what we're seeing there is about two to three return for you for the individual on what they would pay for it
Basically what they can do, kind of dive deeper into exactly where you are in your Airbnb journey
All right. Well, you want me to break down how the call would go? So you kind of know what to expect?
I don't know if that's an issue but if not
I'm having blank space on the calendar.
People with nothing, no credit, no, no
I can just take some notes, get some value
And these for the card, The card you're gonna use for the deposit, does it have a mid initial on it?
It would be really $3,500 a month in net right now.
Yeah, of course. How much money are you trying to make per month from Airbnb?
If you can read the audio
But Covid basically put a stop to that
Okay. What time are you home from class in the afternoon?
So would you mind helping me take down a few quick notes on that for him?
It's gonna be fun and we're hoping that we can maybe transition over to this full time at some point in our near future
And you talked about scaling too, right?
There is just, I don't know it
Every week I guess I get a paycheck of 700
My parents are thinking of the same thing
Yeah, I, I mean, I don't see why not. I don't have nothing to lose. Right.
I'd feel like I was getting somewhere in life
Oh there we go, man. Way to go the extra mile
That's okay that you didn't go through the book
So we always like to take a look at our absolute bottom of the barrel students
So our consultants looks like they're they're actually in meetings with the team today, but we have some spots open tomorrow
So just make sure I'm understanding everything correctly
So is it three 12 for you?
So yeah, it'd be awesome, honestly
And also furnishing, it was a big thing
All right. Well, can you have some kind of video that you can send me out outside the book resources?
And so you know, basically show up the call
Have you heard of the Airbnb arbitrage model?
Okay, well actually what time is it right now for you?
Would you be able to watch it before you speak with him tomorrow night?
So I will have let's say another a hundred thousand
We turned one this year already and kind of look at it, do something with that too
But okay. Yeah. And then if something does come up, I just text you on this number. Excuse me,
This year's gonna be what? So
Oh I see. Down here at bottom <affirmative>
And certainly for you you said five properties was your goal
<affirmative>. You wanna have that security, it sounds like?
That's actually the way Brian teaches it
I think it has potential to go way above that, just what he did
Well I'll get you in the system here to make sure that spot is booked off and reserved for you
But this is more of a let's build it up, let's go as fast as we can, but let's build it up over time
Where do you feel like that comes from for you?
Is that something you're looking for? Yeah
Jackson just makes sure place manually on his calendar like this, like a hundred percent does fully watch the pre-call video that we made
Okay. Four or four 30, which one's better for you?
Hey, well I actually work with Brian and I'm a student success manager so I wanted to reach out and see how you're doing.
And I hope you guys have an amazing rest of your evening
If I get I'm able to get results from this, then it probably would come in later, but not initially
I mean, I get to do probably a month and a half worth of traveling right now
I believe me, I was taking it step by step, but something happened and it just got me off the rails
That's what I do with my free time too
Two to five I would say two to 5,000 pairing.
Yeah, I mean even Brian Page, this is crazy
But yeah, I mean essentially the, you're gonna be cleaning the property, having a team come in and professionally clean it every single week
All these guys have personally done six, even seven figures with their personal Airbnb business
But that was when I had my team and so <affirmative>
So yeah, what so far has been holding you back from getting into Airbnbs?
Oh, okay. So I could just watch it now if I'm free.
I don't know, it is later in the day over on the east coast
Well just a quick question for you
It'll bring in more income than the Airbnb
Okay. 1830. Okay, understood. Well now I have a noon eastern time tomorrow. You wanna do that? Can you make That
Of course, if they're looking to sell, that's a different story
All right. So would that be possible?
Do you want to just put me on hold and give her a ring right now? Just double check with her
Let me see, 3, 4, 7 30 central standard time.
So she's definitely gonna be able to help you out with given what you wanna do and give in your current situation right now
We raised three kids here in Montana and we were 20 years old when we had the first one
That's definitely a path you can take and it sounds like,
And so I'm be very happy to start and we'll just pretend it didn't happen and we're gonna have a new day to begin
And on average you're acquiring one new property every 45 days
So I'd say 10 per month passive, because I make good money per year already as it is
T libby nine aol.com. Is that the best email for you?
Okay, thank you. Thank you very much.
Yeah, there would be. If you get me thinking, you know how
Yes we have some big companies around and we're also close to an airport so that helps things
You might have gotten two emails from them.
Gotcha. Well let me see if one of our executive consultants has some time to hop on a call with you tomorrow. Yeah, yeah,
She'll also, if you giving me the name that that's good enough for me. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. So that way I'll know.
So I mean, you said that your available capital total, everything you got saved up plus credit cards
Good. So what is your job to actually schedule the coaching call?
I mean, my wife and I make a good living and we're both pretty busy professionals
And your last name is Ty, right?
I guess I just wanna figure out
Oh yeah, I actually started a fitness company with a friend of mine.
No, just in total Right now.
So I'm not sure what time's on you're in,
I think it would be a great fit for me. Definitely. I've been a realtor before
Family house have for the family to come visit
And again, I'm not trying to brag you, but I see the value of coaching
But did you the concepts in the book, the rental properties and Airbnb arbitrage, anything like that?
So you're gonna be talking to our head executive consultant, Mr
Yeah, it's, It's very uncommon. Common sense is very uncommon.
<affirmative>. Yep. That's my direct line here.
Eastern standard time and then you said 11, so we'll do 11 Eastern
Other job was 12 miles an hour it time to cash in
I mean, yeah, I live in 45 minutes, 40 minutes from New York City, so that's not a problem
They get everybody cohesion, get everybody working towards the same thing
They work close with Brian, they have more time to go into depth with you
But the hey, the more income the better
Do you have my email? Yeah, my number
And now we have people that are doing a hundred percent occupancy like clockwork
Talk about what's working well in the market right now
Yeah, I can't do, again, I'm in the middle of lunch
I mean, you can definitely work that out and everything
Yeah, usually we just do a double confirmation but given that it's taking a few minutes to come through, I can just let Mr
So why don't you do this
He's the type that he wants
Because you'd have to probably deal with somebody more local, wouldn't you?
I don't know. I haven't had a life, so I don't know what that's like. What do people,
So you thought, man if I can get 10 properties that's 15 K a month for me in passive income
I be able to do one 30, that might work.
Yes. Can you tell me what area he'd be calling from?
And I'm just not old enough to retire.
I mean there's the thousand reasons why people will tell you you can't do something
And so I appreciate you being so open and tell me what's going on with you
To go back to what you were saying,
We can bang it out on your phone
And that is like I hundred percent believe you can achieve that
Okay, so it looks like the 4:00 PM Eastern is available Mr
What does your work look like at the airport?
Yeah, yeah. That's going on right now, <laugh>, matter of fact.
Will you guys both be able to watch that all the way through prior to the appointment on Saturday?
Nah, I won't be too much babe
But Gavin, look forward to hearing how it goes to you and I hope you have an awesome rest of your day
I'll let him know that you're, you watching the video beforehand
Would you have enough to travel and do all that stuff still or
Don Stratton in the same group chat
This is more of a program to follow to get to that instead of trying to do it on your own
I got people trying to talk to me and
That's awesome. And how do you feel like having a successful Airbnb business will help you? Those things?
So I'm gonna put you with Ms
He booked 90% of the time.
And I'll send you a calendar invite there
I mean, because it'll show up on my phone what area calling from
I'll put in as many hours as required
And I'm gonna say the, right now the business income as of yesterday, p and l at that one was like 115,000
Everything is taken care of. Right. Check
That's like, that's such a beautiful vision that you have
Yes. Now what was you asking me again?
I have some autonomy and that I can still do my research
I know, right. <laugh>. All right, well I'll be ready at three.
Okay. Oh, well, tell me, did you read through that book? What did you think?
Gotcha. And why do you feel like you're kind of struggling with that?
So I mean, how much available capital or cash do you have saved up right now?
I guess I can say I have a little under 10 on me right now
So you're having trouble finding properties you could actually rent and put on Airbnb right now,
I get that you send me a text deal, make sure you're good to go
Obviously about a regular job where you're kind of limited by salary and stuff like that
And with 40, about 3000 with them
Just wanted to triple check on that time because we do have a hundred dollars fee for reschedules cancellations or no-shows for these appointments
I can do it for you
How about three o'clock? So 21st, That's next. That's two days from now?
I might have actually. I might have
While you're pulling that up quick question here
Because if you buy a house you're invested at 1
Cool, brother. Sounds good. Great talking to you. Enjoy the rest of your evening and the rest of your week. Okay, We'll talk to you soon.
Okay, because I know five 30 was an iffy time for you for tomorrow
And I'll tell you another thing for me would be to get my kids involved in it
No, I don't care about the family. I mostly don't talk to them anyways.
Now obviously if that's the case, then yeah that does require a higher level of investment
We were out here in Arizona, Scottsdale, West's up. Yeah. Beautiful. We have some working right here. Then some. What's up?
No. I probably inquired on it one time and never did read it, but
I've never been. And it seems like it might be safe.
I work here for Brian Page
I think I got the, I
The only last thing before the call is Mr
So I appreciate you opening up to me and let me in to what's going on
Just wanted to triple check just cuz we do have a policy to charge a hundred dollars cancellation or reschedule fee for these appointments
So Cody, I'm curious to how this goes to you
No, no, I said I have a business partner, somebody I'm already considering this with
You can a hundred percent tomorrow
I just am getting my mind getting spun around just at the moment
So the last thing I'm required to do is just fill out a little form so that Mr
<laugh>, You forgot man. What's my mother's maiden name and remember all the password keywords?
Right? That's definitely a solid starting point
40,000 free cash flow or I need to be per month netting
So that you can coordinate with Dominic here
Cool, brother. Sounds good. Now we're all set.
Apparently that's like two to three. You get two to three x out of it what you would normally get.
Yes. Yes. And my name is Cooper.
Can you hold on one second? Sorry
Did I go into depth in reading the book? Probably not as much, but that does seem no worries
And so 11:00 AM Eastern on Tuesday the first
Like when you have no expenses, 15 grand, well obviously grow so you call it after taxes 12
So it's like a win-win on all sides, right?
Okay, let's do Tuesday at four 30 on my work calendar. I'll clear.
L A N C E R
He doesn't have a website or something like that
I'm gonna get you on with Noah Benno, he's actually our top executive consultant
I would love to do that. I also like to face,
Sounds great. And extra change really matters.
That's amazing. You're calling right now, man. Wow. I mean that talk about,
So 1500 a month income and then some of those assets
I have to be after three o'clock or any time on the weekends
And so they'll hit the phones and they'll bring me deals and we'll split the profits on 'em or something
I know I've been getting so many of those too
They can call me tomorrow morning on the weekends I won't be available. They can call me tomorrow morning, that's fine.
Yeah, I'm on the wrong date
And I haven't done, one of the things Brian talked about was at first was to Airbnb out places you rent
Oh, well I greatly appreciate it,
They work closely with Brian and their top tier
Awesome. And how long have you been doing that for?
So typically what we see is that once you've seen about eight properties, are average student's gonna lock in one deal
Right now, right now, Right now it's 6 22 where I'm at. What
Yeah, so that's kinda how I was thinking too for a while.
Do you have 45 to 60 minutes available at 9:00 AM
That I can invest over a million.
So as of, Yeah, for sure. As of checking and savings though anything there or nothing significant?
I wanna call it a curse, but something basically stop that process and start it with me, if that makes sense
Awesome. And you press add to Google calendar and you'd be good to go. You got it?
Okay. Lemme see here. I'm looking up Matt Ramsey right now.
So really we got the green line from Brian to hook people up with free resources
Now obviously if that's the case, well then that does require a higher level of investment
Yeah, that's literally what I was thinking
So were you potentially looking at getting some smaller units? I
I'm a manager on Brian Page's student success team <laugh>
Awesome. Well can you make sure that they're on the call as well?
Man. What would that be like for you to be able to start spending more time doing that?
I greatly appreciate it. Yeah, I would definitely appreciate the opportunity
Well the reason I'm calling, and don't worry, I'm not here to sell you anything
I mean, yeah, I know there's probably a long,
I mean, I'm definitely interested to talk to one of the consultants
It's about being able to move your mom out here, being able to move your sister out here and just have them closer
So for you, in a perfect world, no boundaries
No, I don't remember what it was. It's about 70, $70,000, I think. 72, I think about 70.
You can actually just throw me on hold and give him a call. I don't mind hanging out. Right, right here for a sec.
Yeah man it's definitely a good gig.
Well, I mean, don't feel bad that you haven't gotten started
I like a car and I drive several but I'm not I got a buddy tell me to go buy a car
Be great. Is there additional cost or I'm already grandfather in the program. How would it work?
Is that something you wanna take advantage of?
Well here's the thing, I'm here to hook you up any way I can
No, I'm working is the problem. Can we do anything at nights or next a week from today?
Could you commit to watching that before your call with her on Monday?
You can get started with a partner
No, but it's one my it's on my bucket list.
So no traffic in the Washington and area
And to be completely transparent with you, my job here, I'm kinda like the customer success manager
I'll just do that for right now and then I'll be on a hunt
They work closer with Brian, they have much more time to do calls
I'm tired of the hamster wheel
Remind yourself, alarm, reminder, whatever I send over the calendar invite and I also text you
Call deposit as it'll show up as, and then I'll go ahead and finalize you for that time
But sounds like you guys are available at that time, so it shouldn't be an issue for you
I don't have a goal, but it's just making money
So it seems like you're pretty skeptical of anything like that
You don't have to buy any homes, don't have to put any mortgages down
But what is it for you? What do you really want with the financial freedom? I know you said travel
Be safe? Five 30 And you said it's a 40 minute call?
I said my name is Cooper, I'm, I'm work with Brian Page with Bmb Formula
If I have your right, so
Currently? I believe it is 7 29
So this is excellent time for you guys to help me out and get better or to do better
No, I'd probably do something like that already talking about would I be able to have my girlfriend sit with me?
All right. Well thank you very much for your time, Thomas. Sure. I appreciate you calling me back.
Do you have much residual income right now?
Okay. Do you want me to break down how that call would go if I can find some availability in their calendar?
No, I mean I'm definitely interested. So gimme the break. So basically they're gonna call me and we're gonna set up a meeting,
I'm curious for you, I mean what made you feel excited about Airbnb in the first place?
You've all, you've been wanting to get into this, it's just a matter of figuring out how
Awesome, thank you Sterling, I appreciate you committed to that
So there's a couple little tricks and stuff like that and we can kind of get into that
The only other thing before the call Mr
How much are you working on it? How much have you automated? How much have you delegated?
Yeah, I mean cause my thing is if you not, I'm not doing it right now. Right? So
In fact, they're a huge drawback
With both properties I would clear anywhere from seven to $10,000 in April May, June, July
So if you don't mind me asking, what kind of numbers are you putting up
So are you guys offering anything that I have to pay for or a mentorship or what guidance? What are you guys guys offering?
Mondays are typically the worst day for me because my construction company is just gets up and running on Monday
You may have gotten two emails and one of those emails gonna be a link after calendar. Calendar.
That's gross. So 17, like one seven?
So it also just basically wiped out the card number and expiration
But it is only gonna be about 25,000 profits
<laugh>. It was a while back, wasn't it?
Is there a Bmb formula website specifically or a member area
The reason I'm calling you is I'm the manager, our student success team for Brian
Goer has the context that he needs to help figure out what kind of leases you can get approved for
Yeah, last time I checked it was like 6 56 or 6 57.
Well, for instance, right now I was just approved in Jersey
Go ahead and say your name and why you're calling
Do you want me to share it?
<affirmative>. Okay, gotcha. And that would be a central time zone. What time is it? Is it for you Right now
All right. Well man, have a nice night.
All right, give me a few seconds here and I'll see if I can get you in for that time
So the last thing that I'm required to do is just fill out a little form here
Nope. Tomorrow, Friday the 22nd don't have work. I have the day off.
Really the reason I'm actually reaching out.
But I would love to sit down, you said this guy knows maybe a little more of the technical side
I couldn't really invest the time that was needed
If I'm able to build wealth and I can show her the same way, then she can be financially independent as well
And so I'll just let him know that
And just make sure everyone's time is respected on the call
All right. Yeah, good getting to know you. Have a great rest of your week and we'll talk to you soon. Okay.
What these guys can do for you is break down where you're at, dive deeper into what's going on with your Airbnb journey
Perfect. Sounds good. I'll lock it in and make it happen for you.
Awesome. I appreciate it, man. Thanks so much.
No, I have not considered making contracts with people who own properties and then renting them out
So I was definitely looking at going into it in my area cause it's actually a thing to do in my area
I've got dinner plans getting ready, head out right now with some friends and so yeah, we're gonna sort of be tied up
So I mean, that's all the call's about, right? Got a little bit of power here
I can also send you over some extra videos you can go through as well
Cool. Well how much do you know about the Airbnb arbitrage strategy?
What time? So afternoon? There's absolute, there's no for next week, next week? No, you don't have any off
So I don't know. So I'm always down to try new things, so I would definitely give it a shot when I'm ready.
Yeah, I could. But in what way would you guys assist? In what areas do you differently be assistant?
Oh, so do I. Yeah, we're in a, Oh not, Yeah, I live in Scottsdale. I actually live in Gilbert, but I basically Scottsdale.
Okay. And then what's your gross annual income? Like the number you can actually verify with a tax return from last year?
<affirmative>. Yeah, for sure. Mean what would you do with an extra 20 to $30,000 a month coming in?
I'm 19. Well I lied. I just turned 20
Yeah, hello. How you doing? This is Juan Rodriguez. I returning your call. You had called me but it got cut off.
Bart Serrati, C E R R A T i.
Well I don't wanna make any promises I can't keep, Of course
I can buy a U-Haul and move my stuff that way but I don't even have, I had to leave everything back home
Yeah, if I could figure out the financial part of
I don't think that's the question. Come on. I mean, almost 48 years old, that's not a question to ask a 40 year old man
Great. When are you gonna send the video?
So for you guys, your husband, in a perfect world, what was the ideal income you were hoping to achieve
Years five. Wow, okay. And if you guys had a hundred a year coming in with Airbnb, would she be able to retire earlier?
You have information on me, there's information, you can get information from anywhere, Right? On people
Annual income? Oh, just a second. 52.
Right on. Gotcha. Would you go alone or would you take someone with you?
I didn't necessarily have an exact number in mind cuz like I said, I didn't have any intent to leave with my current employer
How did it become financially independent on Airbnb without owning property?
I don't know what, if you understand what I mean?
But it's just basically to help out, give back to people
Okay. You get it back after the call you said? Yeah.
It might be somewhere around like 9,000.
Yeah, so I run a alarm company
Where do you take notes? Because honestly I only unlock this in if you're a 10
I've lived in Phoenix for, I've lived in Phoenix since 97.
I mean, are you asking me what I'm starting out? What do I expect it to be like? You know what I mean?
So I would like to get to where I'm making a six figure income passively
All right, talk to you later. Bye-Bye.
I would just travel and travel and travel and travel and travel and travel
And so you're 67, wife is still working full time
Right now I just not stop
But I have to go out there and work for that
But I know that nothing is for free because their time is valuable as well
Yeah, so there's a lot of untapped potential
Gotcha. You're further ahead than most people I call, they haven't even read the book so <laugh> further ahead to that man. <laugh>.
There's not a lot of comparisons
And I feel for you on that
The eighth? Yeah, 11 will work
Well that should be all the context that Mr
But dude, honestly, you not haven't getting started yet
Binal and then once again at the end of your call, he'll go ahead and refund that deposit for you
Hey Brotherhood, this is not my first rodeo so
What is your annual income roughly?
I have no idea on tape.
Well, I got through most of it
Electrical engineering. So are you repairing stuff or what does that mean?
Yeah, no, that sounds great. That's definitely something I would be interested in finding out more.
One last thing before our call, Mr
I'm a subcontractor for adt, so I have a sales team that door knocks
So I'm in the process of clearing up some bad debts, all that
<laugh>. Yeah, for sure. And is that because you're trying to get out of job and go from active to passive income or what?
So we can make up for some of the calls you missed and get you going,
I'm gonna send over a 12 minute video that's important background information on Brian Page and the Airbnb process
Nothing you can get in without investing into it
No, no, no. A flat tire. Flat tire, but I had it now
It's actually my name W Reyes.
So that's still, that works for you
I'm free in the mornings, so before 12 and then class before 15 in May. Can make time any time in there.
To be honest, neither one, I'm in the middle of construction at that point
But if there's a case we'll charge the card we have on file from when you got the course
But I could manage a call after 5:00 PM no problem
To have that into the figures
And so I'd love to maybe help you out get you some better information here
I have R dot fallon yahoo.com.
What they can do is basically dive deeper into exactly where you are in your Airbnb journey
He's already got 14 properties and he's gonna net $25,000 this month
Let's dream together. Everybody around me to be happy.
And to date, he's now, he has up to 14 properties and he's netting about $25,000 a month
Well, I get probably about five grand a month right now.
That's the reality we're looking at
I don't know, just tired of working for people right now
Do you mind fill that out real quick? There's a few questions here
I'll let him know that you guys are watching that video before your call
And do you have about 45 minutes available at 4:00 PM to walk through that process? How to get your first property?
But if I know when I need to take the schedule out and make it a priority to give time I will do that
Yeah, so Brian actually recommends that you find properties that already have their own furniture
This isn't something I'm calling in Airbnb
Call cause I wanna get moving. Yeah.
At the end of the day, the money and the investments are more or less tools to get you what you want
I'm glad we could connect today and kind of chat about some of those things
I said, You can't arrest me cuz I said, I'm legit
Has it been in your name?
So those two properties, how's that been for you so far? You cash one off of those?
She knows I'm, she knows I'm good with what I do and stuff and can trust me
So it doesn't matter to me
Do you have just three minutes?
I'm retired and was trying to do something that with that without spending the fortune obviously, but I know there's <affirmative> involved with that
We actually connected him with one of the consultants on our team and after that he was really kind of off to the races
I want somebody to actually, okay, hey what it seems like this points right here in your town are hotspots
So yeah, I'm definitely more willing to have that call
<laugh>. Yeah. Why is that important to you doing that?
I mean you're operating from a place of confidence and Correct
This is where you should put an Airbnb and I'm a hundred percent sure that it's gonna be very successful
Cause it's not always gonna work for everybody
Yeah dude. Well cause they always hold you and try to give you fucking food for a whole deal, right? <laugh> not cool at all.
So that'd be a nice <affirmative> place <affirmative>
About a hundred thousand dollars from those properties
But these were ideal, had super high end right in the midst of downtown
And the reason why we have that policy in place is just obviously we want to protect our executive consultants time
Gotcha. Okay, cool. What time is your lunch break?
I mean, that's one of the first things you said, but I mean, why is that important to you?
I work around the distractions like my bird, but I would be sure
And then in top right you're gonna see a plus and you press plus <affirmative>
Calendar. I don't even want, Hold on second here. Yeah, I could do anything before 12 after Of course after nine, but before 1230.
It takes care of my bills at the ranch and it also gives a little bit of extra spending money as well
So I'm gonna send over a calendar invite to you at the email attack on Titan 1 0 1 45
Wow. Seven 30 to eight 30 every day.
So do you know what your credit score is last time you checked?
And then his name will be on the calendar invite as well
I'll go ahead and just forward that to you right now
14 years. Wow. What do you do?
I love the way you're thinking big
My dad passed away 17, 18 years ago
I would say at least probably between two to 4,000. Hello? Hello?
And I just remember thinking, oh snap
Somewhere in California, I believe It's so Cal, Orange County area.
It's like a gambling town with some, what do you call it? Some casinos and hotels and all that stuff
I mean there's always kind of a game changer from there in most cases
But how does that sound on your end?
Calendar. I see a link that I see something that say Customer cancel or reschedule link. Do I click that?
And now we're not out of it, but the Airbnb markets going nuts cause everyone would rather stay here than a hotel
It would be great to So monthly?
Maybe I could start doing this
So he has full transparency of what you wanna do
I'd love to hear how the journey goes for you
You just help me fill it out really quick
We've seen a ton of things
4k a month prior to taxes
Because you don't have funnel for any of it, It's very low tech
Well just quick question for you here
Right now, I mean, yeah, I just don't have a lot of free money right now.
We'll get you locked in 11:00 AM Pacific tomorrow
I didn't have any resource, I had no backing
I thought he'd make it a little harder to share without me
Hey Cody, this is Thomas with Bmb Formula
What would you do if you had that much coming in per month?
Brian. Hey Brian. This is Cooper. I work with Brian Page. Hopefully that name rings a bell. How you doing?
I'd have to take a look at the calendar here first, see what we can do. But how's that sound?
Oh yeah. That's great. Well, where would you guys go? Where would you take her
So just to clarify, the call wouldn't be today? I think they're completely booked up
And I know I need help, but I also need money because mentorship ain't free
They work directly with Brian Page himself, and these guys are getting paid like a thousand bucks just for a single hour of consulting
And so this is more of a long term investment approach for you
And so that's what we found is that if someone was just able to get that first property,
Well, I was doing real good at one time, but I'm not doing well I need to do right now
So you may not have a credit score
Okay. How do I accept it? I'm looking at it, but
Okay. So how do you feel like being at $1,600 a month is affecting your ability to help your mom out?
And he told my manager and he said outside of acquiring new properties, he only works about five to six hours per week on this.
Well, I would hire people to do the work that I don't like to do.
We see each other and talk to each other on a day to day basis
This is the bank looking at this sort of stuff
<laugh>. Is it coming through a spam?
All right. That's a standard, that's a staple and standard in the program itself, right?
Not even sure anymore. It was over a thousand dollars I'm sure.
<laugh>? I mean, I think there's a limit at lot. Yeah. I
Well, so I mean here's kind of my thought process on our team
No, I think it may have been a digital
Have you been to New York City?
I'll email that to you right after this, be able to watch that before the call
To my father and my uncle and I just was losing people left
For a living? I just clean tools that they bring just to clean 'em. Pretty much just clean.
So it's an 80 I am very much interested in right now
Do you actually know the numbers behind it?
She's sick, she's not in great health, but she's not in poor health, but she just needs an overseer
So you stop that process and build it
I'd have to have confidence that that would be a stable
So I'm not in a position where I want to take on even more
Talk to people about getting into Airbnbs and just some people who I know want a better life
Well, I guess a 10 then.
I knew you weren't going to sitting here and you know, never know who's watching
So I was thinking that would be the opportunity that I could capitalize on
So for these appointments, I'm not allowed or even able to book past 48 hours out in advance
Okay. And how are things going?
Joe stable needs to figure out what's best for you
So I just wanna be fully transparent with you and make sure that you could make it
Well that's also, I mean that's good awareness to be aware of that fact that you feel that way
Gotcha. And you have about 45 minutes available at 5:00 PM
So I just sure that it's all good
If I have more forms of income coming in
That's something maybe later on down the road
I'm super excited to see how this conversation goes
Renzi know that you will watch the video and you'll, you'll be ready to go at 8:00 AM on Thursday
Go again? Could you please run that by me again?
I don't know how to can cash out on that
Okay. So do you have any credit cards?
So you're at over six 20, credit score, a hundred k income three to 4K in capital and Airbnb business
And then we'll probably get back into it at some point
It's a little over 600, like six 80.
Keep it, keep it for five, I mean keep it for five
That's where I've been putting a little bit of my time
And in what other ways or just do it
So when I was looking at to rent to use the used for and B, not the rental, they're all up
Foxworth, F O X W O R T H, Foxworth. And it's one word,
Could you watch that with your wife before you guys hop on the call so you guys are on the same page with Airbnb?
Would you feel more comfortable just having me send you a link to our third party payment processor? No
I mean, traveling is a wonderful thing a lot of people like to do, especially in retirement
It was right on the trailer to, So I'm 15 minutes away from the beach day now.
I'm gonna put you with Mr
Ooh, I don't know if I can wait
Now I gotta take a look at the calendar first, but how's that sound?
We don't have one after that, but we could set you up on a time on Monday at 5:00 PM
Trying to see how they even calculate things up and what is a reasonable goal
Yeah, I mean it sounds like what you, you 70 k off that one property alone? Yeah.
Do you have a spouse or a business partner that would be involved in your Airbnb business?
And then in the bottom there should be a four from tabs. You could click on the alarm tab,
And I mean these guys are literally the best in the business at this
And so you saw this, you're going to this Airbnb meeting, you're like, Huh, you guys are probably making a lot of money
At what time did you say 9:00 AM?
I work quite a bit <affirmative>, but yeah
Okay. And that would just be a stepping stone. If you got there, everything was going smoothly, would you keep going?
Yeah. That's awesome. What would that be like man, having 15 K a month in passive income?
Awesome. So you seven 30 credit 180 5 income and then 10 15 K for deposits and leases?
I had to file bankruptcy about six months ago and in doing so, my credit scores down
No, I've got a home right now. I'm in Chicago and looking to move to Florida.
It's kind of like you kind of gotta just pick your focus
I just am starting a new job and I'm moving to a new city
Did you say you're already in the course?
I'm sorry, I need to show you on hold for a second, please.
I mean our kids are going up and we don't really have anything tying us down except for my job right now
I didn't really, it's really hard to make it happen by myself with my own efforts
Okay, got it. And then what's your gross annual income, the number you'd be able to verify with a tax from last year?
Bewa does ask, anytime I schedule someone on his calendar, I send him over an important pre-call video to watch
Hyde Park, New York. Interesting. There's no name or anything on there?
Now just to double check here, I do have a five o'clock Pacific time on Wednesday open
Do about 45 minutes at five for them to dive into the stuff with you.
Everybody would probably would be happier with more money per month
And your husband play golf together?
And now I just wanna make sure that I have everything and I've got your email on file so I have jp cuts yahoo
That's really cool. And a question for you, how do you feel that having an Airbnb business would help you get there?
I just bought two new TVs and I just ordered two more beds for the other two rooms
I'll reach out to Diane, I'll send over an update
And so I a hundred percent understand that money's used for a tool
And I could spend more time having fun.
So I went down from a fourth to a 20, minimum, a minimum and 20, I won't go lower than that but 20
Awesome. July, I've had a pleasure talking with you and that I look forward to seeing how your call goes today.
Hey, it's Cooper with Bmb Formula. I'm Brian Page's team. How you doing?
Say you want to go visit and block out a week or a weekend, you can just go stay in your place
Well this is a real low barrier to entry to type of real estate that you can actually get into
Lopez got huge names behind us
Brian Page asked me to give you a call to reach out and see how you were doing on your Airbnb journey so far
Cause once I'm just setting myself up now credit wise with my job, I make decent money but I make six figures
They actually work directly with Brian Page who wrote the book
Perfect. Thank you. Have a good one.
Okay, so Little Beach, You're a beach type of person
I'm limitedly to getting my parents into it
Yeah, pay 'em back and then you get to keep whats in the middle
Probably I'd say between 12 to 1500.
I already don't know what I'm gonna do with the current wealth that I do have
Okay, here we go. All right, let me go ahead and pull this up here.
Obviously your time is incredibly valuable as well
I have too. I've seen it all and I've seen what's possible.
I just need to know how that's it
Okay, well then it sounds like I called you at the right time.
We'll talk soon. Thank you very much. Have a great day.
Okay. I'm only good open, I
You want some chairs in the garage or whatever
Wave this for free, charge that something you wanna do?
Well that's make that happen for you man
Oh man, what I would like to have truthfully in a month, at least 10,000. Okay. A month doing why
But as far as the call here, I'm actually got a little bit of power here
<laugh>. Yeah, I can imagine. I've got some cousins up in Minnesota and yeah, winters are a bit brutal.
Okay, so then a little bit of furniture
So I actually have, let's see, last year it's not very much cuz I'm not on this company. So we're, we're probably 50 60.
Hey, it's Thomas. It's B Formula from Brian Pages team. How you doing?
Sure. I always willing to learn,
The email contracts for you, is that a good one for her to send those credentials to?
I'll make sure to let Mr
You're able to make them be passive
<affirmative>. And by the way, if that does happen, we just charge it to the card that we have back from when you got the book.
Just building a little bit more having another stream of income.
On Monday, which is 12 six, right
So in a perfect world, no boundaries
Okay, cool. So for the card that you're gonna use, the deposit, does it have a middle initial on it?
And that's why really I think the biggest needle mover for you is to speak with one of our Airbnb experts
Definitely. You want me to share it?
Concerned, if you were to get to that
Tempest and just as a part of his consulting process, he always wants to make sure he's helping anyone that needs to be helped
So that wouldn't be an option for us
Just wanted to triple check on that time
But we're both gonna have a pretty good pension
Yeah, I'm not sure exactly what you're looking to find
Is an essential money for this supposed to be coaching program
So I'm really excited Andrew, I've enjoyed talking with you
I mean, yeah, with that said, yeah,
I should say something along the lines of your confirmed with Mr. Rob Smith. Okay.
Okay, understood. Do you want to do what would be safe if you wanna do maybe a two o'clock or a three 30 in the afternoon?
Residual income, paths of income, not having to work for every single dollar every hour that you make. Right
You can obviously do some simple math there, but it begins to add up
That's what awesome means to me
No, I don't have Venmo. I have PayPal.
So would you be available at two in the afternoon or three 30 tomorrow?
<laugh>, don't worry. I don't care what you got going on, just come on.
Yeah, it's closer. I was pronounced fray, but that's actually pretty good.
I think I can do, it has to be some time next week and I'll have to go to San Francisco. Yeah.
Shoot for something tomorrow, because I do have a kiddo that I have to pick up from school. So what time tomorrow?
First thing first is what is your credit score?
So if that does happen, we'll just charge the card that we have on file from when you got the course
Yeah, let's fill it over the phone.
I see win. I appreciate you. I'm gonna have my partner, probably have my manager
So I think I'll be the first millionaire
No. Yeah, I'm gonna watch it for sure.
It looks like I should've just sent Sent
<affirmative>. Gotcha. And this, is that something you wanna do long term or is this more of a
That sounds good. I'll look for it and watch it today.
That's good. So today we have some midday slots like 12 one or 3:00 PM
What was the ideal income you were hoping to get to?
Nope, I can make the call.
Now I gotta take a look at the calendar first, see if there's anything I can do. But how does that sound?
Yeah, right. No, thanks for clarifying. And the first question, Yeah, do you know what your credit score is the last time you checked?
I'm still completely obl oblivious to all that stuff cause I only got halfway through the book
Right? Cause it sounds like getting this going fast is important
Yeah like I said, the last 15 minutes, I guess you could say, I'm gonna have to be on the road
No, that's fine. I'll do that.
So you'd actually get into this business, get yourself off the ground with, I mean, next to nothing if you do it right
So you're putting some serious hours right now
So obviously the first thing to look at when you're going to get a lease is credit score
Sales engineer? Yep. Is that, are you an engineer? Are you in sales?
Well, I'm getting real poor reviews and my cleaners, she sucks.
I will be in Vinita working, so I'll just put a reminder on my phone for five 30
Ready to go 1230 on Wednesday
Yep. All right. Bye bye. Bye bye.
So my goal each year that goes by, because my work a full time job
How long I quit, Hold on.
And then Airbnb doesn't require as much time per week as some other businesses <affirmative>, however, I'm just curious are you working right now?
Is there a reason at all why you wouldn't be able to make it?
Yeah, I'll answer anyway around that time
Totally, totally. And how long have you done that?
I mean there's some variables in there, correct?
I do the whole buy kind of thing
Not much because I have a rental property that my lease, my tenant hasn't paid a dime for over a year or since December, 2020
But a lot of people who are doing Airbnb just don't understand what to do or how to get their properties fully packed
I'm no longer trying to build a life for myself
And you know what, You're honestly in a better position than some people I even hop on these calls with
I mean that's how everyone feels and especially the great people too
That's another reason why I'm trying to find other We ways because this has taken up a lot of my time
Well my life, look it would wouldn't look like a truck, I'll tell you that
Hoping that this is gonna have my number on it
A lot of people have been going through the course or are not able to finish it
Yeah, that would be amazing. <laugh> if I can.
I was trying to call you earlier and then you called him back
Love to hear it. Now, are you in Mountain Time?
Well, okay, let's put it this way
I will let our consultant know that you're watching that video and I'll send it to you after this call
So you're at about 6 55 credit score and about a hundred K annual income
That what you would do if you had a more free time? Travel
Except this time military, someone wants to go and then be like, hey bye <laugh> <laugh>
Well if you can tell me they've got something on a Friday or Saturday or something like that, then I'm definitely a hundred percent interested
We've only been on the phone for a few minutes, but you sound like a really awesome guy
That would be my end goal
Okay, let me just take a peek at the schedule here
And I know in terms of sharing these applications that something you might not be able to do
Based off of, I guess what I have been learning or just reading through the more hands off it
That's basically what I'm calling, that's what the book is about just on the success team
Gotcha. Okay. Okay. And then how far away are you from doing that right now?
The guy's name Jake Jackson. Okay.
Yeah. So what time zone are you in, Luke?
You know what I mean? And kind of pulled back from it because of Covid
Really? Why'd you stop pursuing it?
After today, that'll change. Promise you that. Oh, why believe now? I just wanna make sure you can a hundred percent make that.
So the calendar only lets me book out through Saturday, so I honestly don't have any availability opened up for next week just yet
Part of Mr. Sorry. 11. I don't know. I don't know where that came from.
I'll make sure to let Mr
Yeah, that's the smart thing to do
A lot of times your W2 pay stub, sometimes bank account statements if you don't have a lot of income history
No, Is that just a car payment insurance payment right now?
I feel like it would help me grow
And the reason why we have that policy in place, just obviously we wanna protect our executive consultants' time, typically a thousand dollars slot
So we're not completely risk averse, but we like to have that balanced
Well, was great talking to you
If I could pull some, I've got a little bit of power here
That that's not why I would want to do it
I've got stefano bario perino hotmail
All right. Now I've got Wiggins way gmail.com. Is that the best email for you?
Oh that's awesome. That's great. Well, and how do you feel that having an Airbnb business would help you get there?
And so that was a little bit of accountability
But I appreciate your attitude for us and you're grateful
It's just so they have context
On the road around now? Probably, I think it's gonna take about five years.
Right? Next 30 days or so, We don't need to, Correct. Yeah.
And then next thing you know, two years have gone by two and a half years
Hey, this is Tom's B Formula
I would hope so. I can't imagine it not being, but like I said, I haven't checked it in years, so
That's not the issue at all
Well, just to be doing it at the time and I had Okay time
I'm just curious if you were actually first actually should ask you how much do you need from Airbnb to be financially independent?
<affirmative>. I like it. I it. What'd that be? Being able to do that, to have that freedom.
And in that earlier stage, she's amazing at what she does
What's the legality and what's like how, what's the success rate of these landlords actually willing to do this?
I would continue to do it if I had leads, you know what I'm saying? Yeah,
I'm actually just on Brian's student success team, so my only job is to increase the results of people that purchase the course
That's actually a really great starting point specifically. Yeah, I think I may have,
Even if you got that's you're hitting that a hundred K a month, that'd be amazing
We do three-way calls if needed with husband and wife or business partners all the time, so no worries there
And so you said you've been doing the electric wholesaling for a while
10? I don't know. I feel like taking care, looking after more than 10 would be a little bit stressful at least.
And so it may take a few seconds for the second one to come in
That should be enough in terms of information for him
The earliest for Tuesday is 11:00 AM
That's what awesome would mean to mes like, Oh, let's go here, let's take the trip
So do you mind just help me fill that out real quick? It's super, super fast
You too. Thank you. Take care. Bye.
What? Because like I said, I could just talk to her tomorrow
I can probably, I got a regions website the way it'll give me an update
I know this ain't gonna happen overnight, ain't crazy
And then so that's like what, 40, 48,000 a year
And so you said you had two rental properties already
It's got some really valuable information in there and often answers a lot of questions prior to the call
Yeah, I actually found em pen and paper already.
I don't have a problem with it, but I'm not sure I understand what you're asking me.
Well Steven, I'll go ahead and confirm that in for you and then send over a counter invite
My goal is to get six units going where I live here in Florida. I would love to get more. Yeah.
It's just one of those things like you do so many different strategies for real estate investing
So for you man, you're sounds like you're starting
I would say you can definitely get started with that amount, but I mean for you, I know people, Oh, I
They meet up with friends. They make friends.
Hey Natalie, it's Thomas b b Formula from Brian Page's. Team calling. Check in, see how you're doing with the course so far.
And then obviously going beyond that
And so the process itself is something that I believe in
Okay, gotcha. Is that with your own properties?
There's 150 million users on Airbnb and only 4 million hosts
Ultimately, they're more successful in going this route than folks that are just trying to stack the money up and increase the bank account
Cause I'm currently in a healthcare field, so I like it, but I need something else to satisfy me
Gotcha. Okay, that makes sense. So Kristin, gimme a word. How would you feel that $150,000 a year in passive income,
Amazing. How old are they right now?
<affirmative>. Oh, I wish you would've called me a couple months ago.
Well hear me out on this
So with the next 72 hours, I'll get you an update either way, whether she's responding or not
All right, cool man. Well, we'll talk to you soon. Okay. Have a great rest of your evening.
And a lot of times some people will not think that they're a good fit for that <affirmative>
So how about on Monday? Do you have Monday? We have a few times thoughts available
I close on a property about a month ago and yesterday I had to pay my first rental fee, which was five 30
You and your girlfriend, would you guys be doing this together or is it kind of mainly just you?
Now I'm not even saying, I guess between my wife and I, that would be maybe 60,000 for the year combined
It'll be better, It'll be better than what's in the book, but it wouldn't hurt
So that'd be like four 30 or something. I'd get a video or whatever and then that'd be on the call
It'll be two years in December, so exactly one month from now it'll be two years.
I mean listen to this, we had a guy who started 12 months ago, he already has up to 14 properties now
Where I'm at right now is just really exploring people who doing it and talking to them
Million in a month, Right? That's sort of the get rich quick thing
So I'll take down some notes, ask you some questions later on so they have some time to prepare as well
So it just takes about 20, 30 minutes or so
What do you think you would do there?
And I was like, I kinda knows <inaudible> weekend successful
Well we actually are talking about a book
So I look forward to seeing how it goes to you guys and hearing how you do with Airbnb
Cody West, he does make sure anyone I place on his calendar like this absolutely must watch a pre-call video we put together beforehand
Looks like we got chain with Mr
It's like I've worked for a while
And then a year, two years know knowledge it just came
So yeah, it would give me everything I even looked at buying another bread or Ralph
So it looks like you got in with Ms
All right, looks like we confirmed with Mr
Som curious for you, what made you feel excited about Airbnb in the first place? I know it was a while back
It's kind of, it varies now
We found that they would acquire one new property every 45 days on average
I wanna have more time to spend with my family to do the beautiful things that life has to offer
Great. Do you have a ballpark range of what you think you might be at right now?
Okay. Just double checking. I'm just trying to figure out what else would change for you personally at that level.
But if you cleaning them by yourself because you can't afford to pay people because McDonald's is outbidding you now <affirmative>
I have to drive home, so I'm up at the Airbnb right now and I have to go home tomorrow morning
Unless you could do today at eight, maybe 8:00 PM or eight 30 when my son gets outta gymnastics
Okay. And then what's your billing address? Your preferr billing address?
So from person to person, I won't have to worry about that, right?
So not planned for, but that's what it
Totally, Totally. And how many vacations are you guys able to sneak away? Currently
My only availability as of right now would be next Friday and on
Right? There's a bunch of things <laugh>.
Yeah, I think it would be,
Okay, well if that's the case, you probably have a pretty high credit score
And so I'm gonna send over
I'm gonna email that to you right after we get off the phone
I'll email that to you right after this, but would you be able to watch that at some point between now and Friday?
Annual income? That's like throughout the whole year, correct?
Is tomorrow the 17th or the 16th. Okay. 70. Hold on for a second. I said one 30.
Would it be absolutely impossible for you to squeeze in an hour on Monday or Tuesday?
So it's a five acres of in New Mexico
Something that wouldn't strike my credit anyway
Yeah, yeah, we do it real quick.
And I've been doing that since the early two thousands
Well, and usually people don't invest into a thousand dollars course or something unless there's a specific result they're looking to get
Cause a lot of people haven't even haven't started it and they just fell off
Now I'd have to take a look at their calendars first, but how does all that sound?
So they got on down, went to Florida, they went in
He get you a quick start and end into it
Okay. Sounds good. I'll remember that
Yeah, I just travel more. Yep. And do you have Airbnbs?
Do you know what? To be honest with you, normally I don't even call numbers back that I don't even know
You're never gonna have time to see it
Right. Okay. Understand. What would that mean for you or for your daughter? If she was able to grow up and have a lot more choices
And then just so you have some more context around going a call, I'll send you over two videos between the two
Some real estate math, what you could expect a little bit more about the model
As far as revenues or profits or
So you can watch it literally right now, right after email it to you or just at some point before you speak to him
We have to leave your counters open for paid consultations
And basically all you have to do is watch that before the meeting
And to be able to focus on things that really are going to not only establish an income but also a passive income
And I'm always looking for inflation proof kind of stuff
Close to 800 if it's not.
So <laugh> trying to get to that point for all of 'em and then buy more of them
And so yeah, we are like, it's insane
Well yeah, I'd go back to Paris but then I'd go somewhere else too.
Oh, Airbnb. Oh, I haven't started it yet.
And actually in order to actually get some results with this, cause these guys are literally the best in the business
Like you said, I just need a little bit more passive income coming in to make you get to that eight, nine level
You have Brian's course while back
However, we do have some spots open tomorrow on the 30th
Traveling or travel a lot more.
What's your credit score at right now?
So I, I've not been able to start it just because I'm, I don't know, not home
I also get Diane figure out from her side of things what was going on
So I'm still in the US I have considered doing it where I'm at but I think I could do it
Let's talk about creating passive income with Airbnbs without actually owning the properties themselves
All right. Thank you. I appreciate your help. I'll look forward to that email and watching that video from you.
I definitely will be able to help my family
Oh my goodness, that's no limitations. I'd be like a billion or something. Couldn't. Not realistic though.
Well the truth is I'm not trying to move out of my industry
Sure. Ask that right Joe, stay your
That's an amazing vision that you have you to be able to get out of debt in the next year
I actually know Brian Page personally.
Although she's in Eastern time, so it might be a little bit later
Yeah. That's awesome. How much income did you wanna make with Airbnb?
And I'm fully, I'm dialed in
If we could set up a call, preferably Monday, cuz that would probably be the best time for me
So how may I help you man?
Okay. Do you know what your credit score is at
Talk, So you call yourself a cus customer success manager, right?
Yeah, that's right now, but when I sell my have, I have a townhouses my mother owns, I'll sell
And if you need to text me at any time you can
But if I can double that before I can do that
And he told my manager that outside of acquiring new properties, he's only making working about five to six hours per week on this
It went well. It went well. We were trying a new workout on a beach body, so
My goal is to not have to work and make enough money to do what I want
So it sounds like you know really didn't have that number in your mind
Are we on the same page?
I mean well just getting low, no low ratings and it is just I'm trying to make it better
So how do you feel getting to that much income would help you get there?
Okay. And then ballpark here, what is your current annual income?
Yeah, I honestly, if it's something, if I have the time ahead I will block out the time basically where I can tell you.
Have a great rest of your evening.
Not a problem. I'll be here.
That'd be awesome. I would love to talk to someone about this. This is awesome.
We all just pitched in some money for it
I also want to, Yeah, I'm kind of a little busy today
I mean, just if they truly are looking to rent, that's what they're looking for
But ultimate goal is to reach all my goals
Yeah, that's, that's actually times that we're in over here in Arizona but it is 11 Pacific for your time.
Could you just pull it up really quick and accept it?
What would Todd do with that?
My mom, I've been trying to move my mom down here for the years, but financially just didn't have the means
But yeah, it sounds like you don't remember, maybe it was a while back, you didn't finish it
Email me and yes, I'll send the email over after this call as well
Something else that would prevent you from giving your a hundred percent attention?
Per year, cuz I worked during breaks
Well, the reason I'm calling you is I'm actually the manager on our student success team here for Brian
Yeah, it's gonna be super important for you
Wanna make sure you get what you need to into
Well wish daylight and do it in my office? I could do that.
What do you mean per property or just overall? What number I was looking at overall
Hey, it's Thomas with B Formula from Brian Page's team. How you doing?
And that's just the bottom of the barrel guides that are spending two to three hours a week on this
Is 4:00 PM a time that she can make on Monday as well?
As soon as we hop off this call, I'll reach out to her
I'm working two jobs both not what I wanna do
Cause this point, we've had over 10,000 people purchase the course
No, not at all. Not at all.
That's what I love to do
Hold two more, more minutes, Sean, and then we, we'll wrap it up. Two more minutes. Wait, just hold on.
Okay, we'll say 60 for right now
You guys got anything for Monday?
I mean, I'm sure, sure you can understand
Do you want me to share it?
Go to Florida. Where Grant at? Granite, Florida, right?
Smith know you're watching that and basically it's gonna make sure you guys are on the same page tomorrow or Yeah, for tomorrow
I wanna have multiple income streams so that I can live the lifestyle
Would you just be able to take a peek at that before you speak with him tomorrow?
Oh, I know where, another way I can, this doesn't have it
Yeah, this is my direct work number.
Okay man, just put that note on there
You know guys updated the program without any, made it better without even any impetus and charging anybody else an extra dime
I'm not sure if we watched the same one, maybe we haven't
They stay when they out of town for Airbnb instead of a hotel
Even though it sounds silly, I just like, that's kinda what I'm feeling here
So I just wanna be fully transparent with you, make sure you could make it
It was three times the income for the place
And then brothers with an S
That sounds awesome. And it sounds like your wife is involved with this as well for you guys. You kinda doing this thing together?
I will let her know that you guys were meeting later on next week and it really helped for Ms
I have some friends out in Austin who work for the Bitcoin Foundation, I think Basical the, and they, they're super into it
So it'd probably be a business income of one 50 to 200 this year plus $80,000 salary
So with that said are you excited? Are you down to take advantage of this time with the consultant?
Like I said, I'm close to retirement, so 10, 15,000 a month I'd be happy with
So <affirmative>, I honestly have to look and see how much health insurance would cost
That's all. That's all. Okay, Dan, I appreciate it. I appreciate it, <laugh>. Awesome. Well, Victor, dude, it's been a pleasure talking with you. You
I've been in business here 2014 and we just hit 120 K this year
Okay. And what was your gross annual income last year? The number you'd actually be able to verify with a tax return? Officially
Hey, this is Thomas with B Formula
PayPal, Okay. Let's see. Okay, let me pull something up really quick here. Oh, okay.
I've been working on tug low for 36 years
So it's been awesome and full steam ahead
But out, out of all the people that did, we've seen absolutely incredible success
Cool. Now I've got Gadget thirty1200@yahoo.com. Is that the best email for you? Correct.
It's just the best way for you to have the best 60 minutes, take advantage of everything in the most efficient way
Well, the reason I'm calling is I'm actually the manager of our student success team
But other than that, you're good to go, man
Eastern. Okay. So it looks like we do have a few thoughts open today. Would 3:00 PM 4:00 PM work for you?
And so we are still doing Airbnb, but just in our own house
And get me a boat, make sure I get me a better boat and pay off some bills you already know. Be debt free.
Slow down because I've been kind of living on credit a little bit. I'd say about six 20 something.
<affirmative>. And why has it always been a golf golfers?
So I don't actually have any information for you
And then you get the video too.
That's awesome man. So first place you go to Europe, do you have kids as well or is it just you and the wife?
I didn't let that stop me though
Y'all got got no beaches, this guy still do you?
You're in the military. Awesome. Thank you for your service. Appreciate
And that's why we are working on my credit
Remember said this week right here, this week right here
Yeah, I was able to get started
And on a scale of one to 10, how much are you looking forward to 60 minutes with one of our experts
This past year? About home? About one 50, I guess.
Okay. Do you know what your credit score is at?
All right, dude, drive safe. We'll talk to you soon.
So that's kind of my situation right now
And then as far as Mr
Traveling? Relax, <laugh>, help out my mom who's step back. Yeah, I
Oh I like, no, I don't wanna do that
Are you in Eastern time zone?
So I'm very hesitant right now to do a hard poll on my credit score for preapproval
7 77 60? I don't know. It depends on which three you look at.
What about Saturday actually cause I only have the calendar open for about 48 hours in advance
So it's like job gets done but it's not the way that you want it to
So if you just do the math there, that's two properties in 90 days at 4,000 a month and so on and so forth
We get a lot of Canadian traffic here
Is your best email trinity tk hotmail
Okay. You want me to break down how that call would go if I can find some availability in the calendar?
It sounds like you'll be home by that time
So first thing that I look at when you're gonna get a lease of course is your credit score
Yeah, I mean that would be awesome. That'd be fine.
Yeah, I think you got an ebook.
They're heading for Arizona and Vegas and then they're coming home after their six month snowbird deal and stuff
Yeah, for sure. First of all and eventually wealth. But that's a long, long term goal.
So here, listen to this might help you get some more information and stuff because you're kind of newer to the whole Airbnb business
Absolutely. Cause I'll have plenty of time to get to the folder and figure out exactly where I am. Yeah,
You're good. Thank you man, I appreciate that. Oh yo. Hi. Do you remember ordering Bryan's course a while back on starting the Airbnb business?
Are there Airbnbs around, are there other properties you could potentially Airbnb within about 30 minutes to do?
I, I'm a morning person so I can get up early every day regardless of what time I go to sleep
I'm right on board with you, I hear everything you're saying.
Okay, that sounds about, we sell the course anywhere from a thousand bucks to $2,000. So it sounds in the appropriate
And the reason why we have that in place is obviously we wanna protect our executive consultants' time
And so I'm like, I'm starting to go through it and looking at getting into Airbnbs here cause I'm in Arizona right now
I can actually see myself coming back home, checking on everything, checking on these properties, doing what I need to do
Would I be able to provide a backup email?
I was hiring out outta country <laugh>, hiring those people in the Philippines to do my cold calling and all that
We are out here in Arizona where Phoenix, Arizona area
Well the reason I'm calling you is I'm actually the manager on our student success team here for Brian
You know what I'm saying? Who made millions, if not billions off of this
I get off at three, but we've just been busy this week just cuz of inventory
It looks like we have a 10:00 AM open on Wednesday.
We would definitely want to have her filled in
What are you looking to actually, where are you looking to get with Airbnb?
A little less than success. About six 40 something.
Okay. What was that? Did you have a question?
I'm sorry, you're asking me a ton of personal questions here
Some people wanna buy sports cars, some people wanna travel, some people wanna spend more time with their family and just asking our students
I actually might cancel the appointment
So at any given moment we could be an all day event
No, I mean it was just a book. Yeah, just an e-book or he never got the physical book. It was probably just
It seems like it's going pretty well
Sounds like you got five properties
This is just something that I would have to ask him and be like, Hey, that cool to do
In the get on work again or no, I've got 'em in the morning and then I got one
As a consultant or coach. Yeah.
I don't know if this is the best time I, I'm literally about to do something
I'll introduce you guys in your group chat together
Well, like I said, I'm probably completely retire and go do other things I want to do in life. Travel around and do different things.
And then that will be it
There's only one more thing here and the only last thing done with the form, but Mrs
That's all using the rental arbitrage model
<affirmative> like an hoa, and they don't allow Airbnbs
So is for you, this is not, let's buy some fancy stuff
Just bear with me here while I pull up the calendar and see what we can do while I'm pulling this up
I'm mainly at home with the kids
Probably go to Europe and South America, those places
I can get you in for one 30 today if that works for you
And you'll be able to show up to the call ready? No distractions
Yeah, so this number is actually a team number we have
Yeah, cool. I mean if we can do it tonight. Yeah, if we can do it tonight at seven, that'd be great.
And I love that you have that of the first things you said, which is a huge green light
I'm gonna see what they talking about, man, to see how much value it is
I just mistype that in there, which happens sometimes
<laugh>. Yeah, totally good man. Yeah, my name's Thomas.
You know what I'm saying? I'm not saying build one out a lot of money, but something like that
Okay this is confirming that's the right information and then I think it's everything that Ms
Well, here's kinda my thought process on this
But let me see what I can do
Don't wanna waste yours which again would result in that a hundred dollars cancellation fee
I'm doing wonderful man. Just over here trying to change the world. <laugh>.
I do some special projects and I do some coaching
So feel free as well to prepare questions
<affirmative>. And how much do you need for you to be at that place of financial freedom?
I think I could do that in the first year there in St
Maybe, I don't know, in a year I would expect 10 grand
That's great. Okay. And John, I do wanna schedule a personal call here or do you just wanna wait for the group call?
Mean, is that what they can provide <affirmative>?
So last thing I'm required to do is fill out a little form for Mr
You can share it with your brother if needed
I'd love to hook you up if I can
Hey, it's Cooper with Bmb formula. Brian Page's team. How you doing?
I stayed in the Airbnb out in Florida the first time
Okay. Yeah, for sure. And you feel like getting a little bit more money would help you do that?
I was like whoa, I'll tell it back
So I think I may have a super solid idea of how I can help you given the time we available
Cards. Okay. Are your limits on those?
Oh, okay. Okay, perfect. Yeah. Okay then yeah, I'll be here.
Hello? So I'm just, part of the reason I'm on the phone is I can hook you up with some free resources
Steven, that being said, man, I know you're heading to work, so we'll wrap this up
Tomorrow? I'm free all around my man. I'm not doing anything
The rolling green hills and little villages there are really, really cool to see
No, I work a full-time job.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Do you have my email address?
Okay, well I've actually got a three 30 or a 4:00 PM in the afternoon. Which one of those would work better?
So that wouldn't be a reason, at least not now
So together, those are about 42 minutes long between the two, and that'll give you really solid understanding of the model
Yeah, well actually I'm on the success team here, so I'm not on the sales side
I love the way you think and your attitude and your mindset towards this
You know what I'm saying? But at the same time it, it's all about passion
Two o'clock, three 30 and five o'clock.
And do you have any other questions for me?
And then how much available capital or cash on hand do you have to put into deposits on properties, purchase furniture, stuff like that
Oh good, good. How are you?
Yep, totally. No, you're a hundred percent right. Yeah. Cause it's like if you got to 30, it's like would you stop there?
I'm in Mountain Time and I'm typically available after nine o'clock.
And yeah, man, we have seven properties right now
Hey, this is Thomas with CV Formula from Brian Page's team
That wouldn't be happening in this scenario
It sounds like you have a lot of things that you want to do
So let's see, Do you see any link in there to add to your Google calendar? It should be probably near the top
And we've really had, I mean shit, we've had probably a 10,000 people go through the course at this point
So where will I see it come through or? Oh, right there, Thomas Leaner
Okay, and which time zone are you in?
So for you, man, I'm curious, were you able to get started with Airbnb or what's going on?
In order to protect our executive consultant's time, especially Mr
I just have a few minutes here
So I do some coaching for team members coming into role
All right. And what time do you get off work
So we are booked up for the rest of the week
So on our success team, I'm a executive assistant, however we actually have a full-time team of executive consultants
But however I got into my own, I got more of my investment in some projects
You don't have to worry about bosses, customers, that whole thing
I mean, to be honest with you, I'm 35 years old
I mean I understand about doing this and getting other people's houses and working with them
A lot of people just don't have the capital to be able to purchase multiple properties
But is it cool if I just ask you a couple questions here to see how best I can hook you up?
The goal is not to be cleaning, but right now just the cleaning fees is the profit on one of them
Like I said, it's a learning process
It was the first one you sent
<affirmative>, because we see that's a huge tipping point for people and starts snowballing, the momentum builds from there
And so it sounds like you're really ready for something where you wanna see real results with something that works
Yeah, so my email will come through super page
One of them will just say your booking's confirmed and the other one will say Invitation to meeting with Mr
That would really create more financial freedom for me of course. And I'll be able to, I'm sorry, how much, Okay, I'm sorry.
So it's not something that's challenging
I would want to definitely be able to hook you up with this
The family put her in there and so now I have to find some other kind of income
What would interest me? I'm sorry. No,
Only if it's a good fit normally, if it would be a positive ROI for your portfolio
What can do. Just cause she doesn't get home until three. She actually just walk the door <laugh>.
But actually I do wanna pursue it
Whoa, <laugh> 12 to 14 hours a day. So there's really no automation with that. Just you're in it.
I was just very honest with him and told him, I said, Hey man, I bought a program already
He doesn't even have people buy properties
Yeah, I mean I hope you recover fast and it's good
And then my As, I don't have many assets right now, I just have some estate pending stuff
So it sounds you're run into some of those legal restrictions they have in some yellow zones, like Brian talks about the red zones
All these coaches have personally done six or even seven figures with the personal b and b business <affirmative>
Alrighty. Alrighty. And then Chicago is, I always forget you guys on Central or Eastern Time?
So more on the customer service side, not on the sales side
I'll just kind of knock out a bunch of those
No, that's all I had to say. <laugh>.
Might be later on the East coast
I mean, how do you feel that having an Airbnb business would allow you to be able to get there?
You're helping this person, that person
I had a good business sense and I did this problem managing for years
Probably realistically, cause there's a lot of other things I wanna accomplish within the next 10 or so years
So Jalen, I am super excited to see this call Ghost for you, man
This is two more things we need to cover that take probably about three minutes
You want off the boat, you wanna be on land. That's what it's about for you. It's not just about making more money.
So traveling in the motor home kind of cross country, that's just, that's so fascinating to me
Eight 40. Beautiful. And then what's your current gross annual income, what you put on your tax return?
And then that's essentially, there's a little bit, there's some fees from Airbnb, not like 3%, 4%, but essentially that's what you profit
They're light years ahead of me that they actually work directly with Brian Page himself
I just haven't, haven't been able to finish the course yet and get started
I mean, I just wanted, wasn't sure if you were a legit person or not
I think. Lemme think 11:00 AM Wednesday. Could work.
Exactly is it? I saw your email, your test email, but I don't see the video. I
I'll email that to you right after this
Well Brandi, usually people don't invest a thousand or $2,000 unless there's a really specific result they're looking gonna get to
I wish I can open up more
Be like three. Okay. Like I said, I went through a divorce, so I'm picking up the pieces.
So I, I see a serious opportunity in actually helping you out and maybe pulling some strings back here
I'm not a guru in the computer so it just takes me longer
So you're booked in with Mr
Oh, they're all in my wallet.
Okay. But yeah, other than that I feel like just those two would probably be my biggest obstacles.
<inaudible> regulations and then lay out exactly what needs to happen in order for you to get results
What do you mean? No, I'm just kind of confused. You say you
All right. Got you locked in. I'll email you all the stuff after this and I'll have her name. Her name is Catherine Funk.
Yeah, how can I trust that? You're not gonna take my card info and run though.
And people that I know, they want to be involved, they want to do business with me, they love this idea
There's a lower barrier to entry there, right
Do you mind helping me fill that out?
Oh actually between two you could do so Yeah
Of course I do, I get an appraised and go for all that and I pay somebody to do that
Yeah, it was a while back. Now thinking about two years, you might have gotten it actually just as an ebook form online.
No capital and no type of credit
I love to hear that, man
And that will be my cell phone number in there
Honestly, I need about 50 to hundred units
So I already have half of the battle, I just gotta know what to say and how to say it
Hey, it's hard to mistake that
Which is what I'm seeing on, I just pull it up on Airbnb right here
But yeah man, I just need to see it is basically a comparison and I need to see a D vehicle realistically
So that's what I've been working on for a long time
Oh nice. So what's the total, what's the first property up and running typically 15 to 20.
Your businesses? Yeah, that's from my business. That's from my business, yeah.
I've, I'm actually sitting with my partner right now
Jackson does make sure that anyone I place on his calendar watches a very important pre-call video beforehand
I mean, that's not even a question to ask my time, what I do with my time and how I do it also
I just wanna address what you said about the arbitrage model cuz I mean first off congratulations, you're normal for having those concerns
We do have some programs available depending on where the person's at and really how fast they wanna go
I'm doing all right. How are you?
I can tell you in one second. I got a credit monitoring website. Let's see, as of today let's see, we're at a 6 94 94.
So you saying that Airbnb will want me to put down something? What if I already have something that I can rent?
Awesome. So I'm customer success manager and I really just wanna check in with you and see how you're doing.
Often, how would I see this consultant? Would it be one session?
Yeah, those are period where I
I've been able to do, I'd love to help more people
J. Okay. And what's the card number on that?
Miss Funk needs to figure out what's best for you
So whatever you pressed somehow I think it worked
And then if you just wanna set a reminder or some sort of alarm your phone,
I think you guys will have a lot of things to uncover and help you out more automated
Okay. Let's see. Okay, well it looks confirmed on my side. I'll tell you what, I'll, I'll let Mr. William Butler know
Now we'll get it to you
Well hey, I mean it's just a phone call that I can see if I can push some things around and get you something
Well lemme pull up the calendars and see if we could find a time that we can get you in for
And then the only other things here that I need to fill out, So you're gonna be with Mr
I'd have to refresh my memory.
So I'm ready to get this crap done
I do work a lot, you know what I'm saying? And I like what I do, but it is profitable for me
Hey, I don't know if you remember or not, but it says here, you got Brian's book a while back on starting Airbnb business
it sounds like this is something that's actually really important
I mean, what else would change for you personally at that 30 grand a month coming in?
So you're sitting right there at 11, 11, 12,000
Anyway so I was approved for a mortgage and yeah, that's about it
Like a 9:00 AM or 10:00 AM Pacific on Saturday
So it looks like we actually have some go in into the afternoon, like a 5:00 PM time slot, possibly a 6:00 PM
For sure. It would've to be after work hours, something that could work for you on your calendar if I could find some time that worked.
All right. Well John, appreciate the time you're locked with Mr. Rob Smith and to look forward to hearing how it goes for you.
I don't know if you remember or not, but it says here, you got Brian's book a while back
Well the reason I'm calling and don't worry, I'm not here to sell you something
Again, you're gonna be with Mr
So always at the end of the day, I wanna bring the people in my life with me on the journey I'm going on
Like I said before, I do have a little bit of power
And I'm gonna put you guys in a group chat together and send over an email, send over stuff as well
So I mean usually people don't purchase a book on a business opportunity like this unless there was a specific result they're looking to
Gotcha. So Daniel, what do you do right now?
Typically it is a thousand dollars time slot
I've got let's see, I've got ds lina aol.com, is that the best one for you?
I mean their goal throughout the 60 minutes can also be to service that skip button, so to speak
You sound pretty confident and I trust you
One other question before we solidify everything
I don't have the answer to that. That's why this is an issue for me. Yeah.
Brown needs to figure out what's best for you
You're completely safe and secure and you have to give out your credit card information or anything like that
You said leases. So can we start with one? Cause I'll say like three grand.
It sounds like you have a lot going on in your life and so do our consultants
You can talk about how to be successful with Airbnb and all of that stuff
And I mean that's totally the smart thing to do
That's obviously just to be able to get outta the rat race, whatever you wanna call it
Out here trying to change the world
Right now we have hundreds of multi six figure Airbnb beers and dozens of seven figure Airbnb beers
You want me to share it?
But it's just the way my life is set up right now
I love it man. I'm curious why a million
You send me some digital book, a copy of it, of the digital
And we have people just going crazy
So what is that for you? Why do you want this Airbnb business?
And then the maintenance, I probably had about a couple issues
Hey, listen, I don't know if you remember or not
I just talked about you today
Well it looks like we're locked in
Yeah, I'll be able to watch that this evening.
So I'm allowed to hook you up with some free resources to make that happen
How do you actually go forward from here?
And so Airbnb plays a significant role in that
Now I gotta take a look at the calendar first, but how does that sound?
Cool. Let's see which time's on you in
Awesome. Well I really value that, Dana.
So this is basically the average student
Well, really just kind of the blueprint
And so I just needed a job
Okay. And do you have a specific goal of how much extra income you wanted to make?
If you got a good amount of commission, do you think you'd be closer to 40, 45?
Yeah. When are you gonna send the video?
Have you thought about doing the rental arbitrage model at all?
You're normal <laugh> before any major decision like that
And right now know you're working kind of like part-time at Cafe, which is like, it's enjoyable but definitely not the next 20 years
Who will I be talking to?
My current credit score is six something. It went down a lot but let me just open it right now and got the actual number.
Hey, this is Thomas's B Formula. Brian Page asked me to give you a call to see how your Airbnb journey's going so far.
I mean, before we start talking about me setting up something with money right now
I mean, if they wanted to do Airbnb, they'd be doing it already
Like I said, I just wasn't going crazy
Wow, that's cool man. Where does that, Cause not everyone has that, where does that drive come from for you?
Okay. See if I can actually check some numbers really quick. So you said Canopy Drive,
Okay, understood. And are you familiar with the Airbnb arbitrage model that's talked about in the book?
And then they do that by getting about two new properties and cutting the workload for Airbnb down to about 10 hours a week
Well you know what, I'll pull per calendars here and I can check some time slots
Did you ever go through that at all?
He's got a slight mix, but you can mix it up too
And I see you got the book and the audio book here
I'm like working during the week, I'm working like 12 hour days, so it's kind of hard
Wow. That's a good year. That's awesome.
But currently it would just be me
I just don't wanna do it for 30 years or the nine to five for 30 years.
But like I said, I got a five year old son and that was the same time
Well, just to give you a quick refresher, it's, it's pretty interesting here
And of course I'd be happier with a hell of a lot more than that
My rest of the day looks very busy. Very busy. Okay. Goodness. Yeah.
They're gonna look at a few different things that can determine what you can get approved for
So I need to take a look at the calendar first, see what we could do. But how does that sound?
I, I'd have to talk to her but usually we're both available or free. Probably after 7:00 PM
There is, yes, if you forget the password or as long as you have the email that you bought, whatever
But we're gonna build that up and it'll be steadily growing over the next few months and quite a bit <affirmative>
Gotcha. And for your work history, are you a W two employee or are you a 10 99 or 10 40 self-employment?
Sure. <affirmative> and what they just go over what I want or they actually offer some sort of advice.
What do you do right now for work?
Four or five. So your take home is between two and a half and two and a half thousand dollars a month.
But that wasn't the formula I wanted to use
That is amazing. I'm super excited to hear that you got started. And do you own the properties?
All right, man, we'll plan to follow up here a little bit
It's very, very, you can tell from this call extrovert and talkative <laugh>
California, that's another place too. That's another place too. I would go definitely.
So can you do that for me,
Yeah, those three days are probably the best days that I could say, Hey, I'm probably gonna be home
It's one of the ways to scale the quickest
Thank you so much for calling me. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Of
And the upper three bedrooms in the upper part of the house are what we rent
But <affirmative>, I mean you're already a serial entrepreneur and I see a serious opportunity in helping you out
It's just like 30 minutes, but I'll email that to you
Yeah, of course. Sounds good, brother. Take care. Have a great weekend.
Not having to worry about when to pay the bills,
Just depends on how spacing and thing is
I just had something open up for this afternoon at four 30
Cause the thing that we notice, we've had over 50,000 people purchase that book
We just wanna have full context here just so that we know how to best prescribe things going forward
I work, I'm a supervisor at the Mercedes Benz plant
I mean, I know what to do with my time <affirmative>
Wow. Wow. That's awesome. Yeah. Can you do that right now?
I don't know I, cause I can't look into the future test
So Carlos, really quick, what time zone are you in?
But in just a few months, I could have another 3000 probably in a month or two. Okay.
And then it just had a massive resurgence to the market and everyone was trying to find the closest Airbnb instead of hotels
And we'll be in touch and I'll make sure this happens and we'll this fixed for you
And that's the same river that makes up Lake ksu
Back in 20 20th of March, 2020 rather, and within about six to eight months people were traveling again and occupancy was back up
Well, when I was growing up, I was the only child
Gotcha. And then between the two, how much here you bring home between the two businesses?
But I took that call and I have no idea why
Eastern? Right now It's 5:42 PM Eastern.
How far away? I need to make 10. I need to start creating an income, a passive income of $10,000 a month.
Okay, cool. Yeah, you can just throw a ballpark figure out there. What are you sitting on for that? Is that like 5,000, 10,000?
Those are the people I typically see that are the most successful with Airbnb
I'm elabo way too much on all my different things man
And so that's kinda all we do, these calls us
Okay, cool. And then how much available capital or cash right now do you have to put into deposits on properties, furniture, stuff like that?
How long is the call gonna go?
Yeah, I mean just gimme the, let me know what your currentness is and then
But let's see, what if I can do this? In some cases I'm able to shuffle a couple things around here
I will go ahead and run that right now
Or I've got a four 30 on Tuesday
We have had dozens of students who have hit actually 20 K a month in passive income within their first six months
I haven't really been looking. I've been unemployed for two, three weeks.
Well Christine, first off, I mean congratulations on getting your first property
That's the element you're gonna get
Good for him. Wow, that's a good, Yeah, he <laugh> did it right. Sounds like.
Right, Jeffrey. Good, my man. Hey,
Just to get an idea of where you're at
There's some huge things in there that probably be incredibly profitably profitable for you down the line
And then the second thing they look at is annual verifiable income when you're gonna get a lease
You too, thank you so much.
So she still has that degree though that she has to pay for <laugh>
Okay, so not Monday, How about Tuesday? Four 30?
Okay, sounds good. Well I'll look forward to it.
Do you recall the book and
Well, I mean it would probably just be me
And why 10,000 a month specifically?
<inaudible>, I don't know if I did this right.
Yeah, I mean I feel like anything probably in the five, the 10,000 range would be worthwhile
Yeah, do you want to break down how that call would go if I can find some availability in their calendar?
Yeah, let me ask him. You want me to judge?
Well, for financial freedom to be my reality, what number do I need to hit for that?
I've been thinking about it for the longest so I'm definitely gonna do it
Saying so right now you think it's gonna take three to five years to replace your full-time income with income from your brand
Anyways, just roughly <affirmative> fee stuff anyway
That's how I get a lot of the contracts that I do
And you should see a link to added to, Is
I would just make that money and I would move away
Yeah, I just wanna make sure here, cause the thing is we're not really not allowed to book these past about 48 hours in advance
But now my next role is to be able to expand to more of different roles on the team
Okay. Let's see here. So it looks like we have a 3:00 PM Eastern Time open tomorrow with Mr. Don Stratton
It looks like we have a 1230 Pacific tomorrow or we could do another time slot on Monday
You know guys know the different packages and 6,000 and get the VI and different stuff
I believe you. Now, do you have any credit cards? Again, not saying we have to use it, just full context.
So I'd have to be there in person for that to work
All right. And then the card number whenever you're ready.
I mean it might come off a little bit off putting, but it's really just there to protect the guys times
Cause yeah, that's a good question
He's, he's one of our executive consultants
And it gives me, it's a passion thing for me as well
Good getting to know you today
It's not going eat Chipotle and I can put in my calories so it's much better man
And that property on the low end is profiting them $1,500 per month
Not? Yeah, it would be valuable definitely
So as long as you show up the deployment, you'll be fully refunded
Essentially what's being reported to the government each year is typically what they look at
I mean I still got a couple dollars but like I said, this money page just drank that
So if you just did the math there, within 90 days you'd be netting three to $4,000 a month
I'll text you right after this since you have my number
All right, you too. Take evening.
You said Oh okay I can hear you. You said where would I be driving?
So finally we got open this up and you kinda shared with me what's going on
Just call on the phone number
Just thinking here for a second
I'm not sure I've thought about that eventually, no
Get my access code to log and dig into the course and make it work
Seven o'clock tonight, man, I hope nothing's going on
I understand all this stuff, man
No problem. My fault brother that are you tapped into the b B as well?
I remember vaguely, but I haven't read it. Okay. I would have to search for the email
Wednesday 23rd is currently actually wide open.
He doesn't own any of them and he's netting like $25,000 a month
What's the consequence? Nobody's been fined yet, but they have made it against the law.
I know some people say, Well dude, you just need to do something
Oh, it'd be unlimited if you were capable of doing, it'd be unlimited. I would say.
Oh, work three weeks a month and take a week off.
She would be able to, but I don't know if she'd want to, cuz she has a position that she really loves
And I, I'd hate for you to ever have to pay that
Yeah man, you would be able to do that and really you just want to enjoy life as much as you can
Yeah, he's in pretty high demand
I can make it happen, probably you just give me a time on a Wednesday and I can probably make it happen. Are you
So Kristen, and then just final thing here
Oh yeah, yeah, it sounds like something I'd be interested in doing.
So if you had say at least 10,000, obviously you said you probably wanna get more than that long term, at least 10,000
How much you bringing home each year in annual verifiable income before taxes?
I'll get you in the system right here to make sure that time slot's booked off for you and nobody else will fill it
<laugh>, I, I'm kind of just picturing you wrapping your arms around a big pile of cash. When you say that <laugh>,
But with my mortgage, it being like 1200 a month, I got a Cardinal 5 85 a month with all the other bills
Well, the thing is they're in my son's guitar to our class
There medical bills come up or whatever it may be
Yeah, that would be the plan.
Afternoon, Okay. I've got a one 30 at two o'clock or three 30 tomorrow. What would be the safest bet?
I plan into refinance them within a year and then use those to double it
Perfect. G C t rides. Got it. Dot
So it looks like they're booked up the rest of the day, but we have some spots open tomorrow
Well, I'm getting charged 9 99 a month for something. I don't know what it is, but I think maybe that's,
Tomorrow? Probably won't work for me but let me check my schedule and see. Hold on. Tomorrow is the fourth.
We have a three bedroom house and we have, actually three of the bedrooms are available for rental
But now I'm gonna cut half cause it's money pick
I'll go ahead and send over that calendar invite to you so you can accept it after your call
We also have our personal lines, which I'll actually introduce you and to consolidate in a text chat after this call
Wallet might be, Oh I hope it's not in a car.
Hey Aja, it's Cooper with BNB Formula from Brian Page's team. How are you?
Well, with that said, on a scale from one to 10, you could be honest with me here
It have been about five years ago, to be honest
Just curious of why specifically six, not four, five or seven or eight
Love to see it. I've heard it all.
I'm really not too local to anything
You want me to share it? Okay
Yeah. And Remi, who do you know that has the available capital and or the credit to help you do these deals?
So I'll circle back and figure out what to do with it in a year or so
Perfect. You sure? A hundred percent you can make 10:00 AM tomorrow central time?
So say Airbnb wasn't even the picture you know, had some sort of business that was just making you money
William Butler giving you a call then
There's no idea what you're talking about really
So it's just about 30 minutes
I said if I email that over to you, could you watch that before the call?
So I figured we did it and see what was involved
I haven't really thought about it
So Wow, that's wonderful to hear you already, You're already got it going and with your own house
So, Jason, just need you some context around who I am and why I'm even calling you in the first place
Oi and also send over a calendar invite for you that you can feel free to add that to your calendar afterwards
I'm not saying that, you know what, it's not successful
Will be. That's awesome man. Well
And why five grand a month
It's an older Indus industrial building in a small town there
I mean we've got folks who are putting up pretty insane numbers and we've got people in the middle of the road too
All right, so I work on the first and third and seventh
Will I over here again or? It's 6:31 PM
I think it was 1 21 or 1 26. My husband just did my taxes. It was something around that. Yeah.
You can control what happens and how you wanna run your business
It might make things a little smoother for me
Sounds like it wasn't a great experience.
Is that the best email for you?
That's why I bought an RV to just go poke around and go see all the fun sites. So
Okay. Yeah, so it'd be probably like 180 5 verifiable
But I like what you said about financial freedom and not having to, or being able to do things on your own term
If I take the time to email that to you, will you watch it before your call?
But for some strange reason, something told me to call this number back
Let's see. It would be either in the morning at some point or in the afternoon, honestly, let's just say after,
Oh yeah, definitely. Every bit of information is helpful and critical. You can always learn something from someone
Super easily avoidable on that one there
Just I guess the ultimate forms of income, trying to figure out the most efficient way to try to make money in real estate.
Oh, I'm definitely at a 10.
We don't know how long we'll be here, so we have to make memories
Well Donny, I see we have some slots open on Monday
If I can get you a session with one of these guys
Of course. You're welcome man. Bye. Bye.
It sounds like it's gonna cost me more.
All right, you sent it already?
No, that's pretty much all I got.
Okay. Yeah. What do you got?
As we know a lot of people are gonna request something like that
That's what I was saying Monday. I wasn't gonna be ready Monday. Okay, Tuesday. Perfect.
And I do see some value here in helping you out
I'm sorry. It's Mountain Time and it's 10 15.
Yeah, they'll call you on the phone number
So what's your credit score at right now?
I mean, it's something that I am passionate about
Oh I thought you said, I thought you said he might not be a part, he probably wouldn't be a part
So 6 94 credit, 65 income and then you have eight K basically liquid
And is that honestly, go ahead.
Yeah, and that's just a single property
Cause it's a weekend so I like midnight so my day gave me that day off so I shouldn't be working that night
So Manny, say you're like the smartest guy in the world
Okay. I could do it 10 30.
I'm fantastic. Thanks for asking. Just changing a couple lives today.
What do you mean by that?
You could do it with way less money to get started with it
But I haven't really been through, I'm trying to do so many other different things. I'm trying to do whole sailing and,
You'd be making eight times more money per month
If I had $4,500 a month coming in, I wouldn't having to actually work for that would cover every bill
Yeah, that would work on Monday at five.
Yes. I'll just adjust the appointment, I'll adjust the other appointment that I have earlier prior to that point. Okay. You mm-hmm <affirmative>, just make adjustments.
That's why I was like, well I just wanted to know how much money it'll take to get it going
Sorry, can you rephrase the question? I'm a little confused.
It would be better timing for me
Now obviously if that is the case, that does require a higher level investment
Again, the kiddos being able to go to a nice private school
I'd be willing to pay for that
Really it would just allow me to grow faster, everything
Okay. Sounds good. And just before I lock you in, you can a hundred percent make 10:00 AM on Wednesday, correct?
I know I need, I need, and it's crazy
Well, and yeah, I'll send you a calendar in right, right now.
That's what it comes down to
It'll just be in your email
So for you LA, I'm curious, what made you feel excited about Airbnb in the first place?
But yeah, I don't know if that answers your
So Daniel time zone, are you in?
Okay. Fair enough. And 8:00 AM Pacific time, Thursday, Just before I lock that in, you can a hundred percent make that time.
Is that something you'd wanna do?
You know what I'm saying? Seriously.
We'll we'll get you in here and it was good talking to you, and you have a great rest of your day and week
And so really that's, that's why we like to do these calls for our students
Is there anyone else who would be involved in your Airbnb business?
You have to put that in there?
And then like I said the only last thing is that so I'm gonna put you with Mr
So can't really give you a clear answer on that
They'd rather be in the Airbnb
Some of the landlords I work with collect last month's rent, so I haven't really normalized it yet
So for you, Alan were you able to get into Airbnb or what's going on?
Do you, you know if he'd be available at one 30 tomorrow? Cause Mr
Hey just checking in here. Do you remember spending about a thousand dollars with us on a BNB formula course a while back?
So I mean there's 20 k gone right there
Well, you seem to be giving me, for the most part your undivided attention here
He's gone pretty quick, not the quickest but he is also doing better than a lot of people as well
Well what else? I mean 20 or 30 K a month, it's a lot more than you're making now
I mean, you know what I'm saying? I already completed it cause I got all the stuff
Cause I definitely, my job, I just need more money
So yeah, you're, you're a hundred percent right. I
Cuz it'll put a massive smile on my face and honestly, this is what makes my job fun
Got my car repossessed and that ruined everything
And if you just click yes, then I'll confirm it on our side and then you'll be
So just wanted to be fully transparent with you, make sure that you could make it
Well why are we gonna charge? Cause they just wanna make sure we're there
S siano, well, was good getting to No yet today I will go ahead and lock that in
And then I've got TLOs, ftm, vra, Matt Lu, Luna one, Kda, mtv, Cardo, Cardo is actually my second biggest
I would, but we've to take the right time, man
So it looks like, okay, so you had some troubles with some occupancy there just in some of the off months
Hey, this is Thomas with B Formulas
If it doesn't, like I said, you just let me know right after
We're just adding one now in Florida, our rent is gonna be 5,500 a month
So I'm actually allowed to hook you up with some res resources or materials on the back end of this call
Is that the best email for you? You want me to update that?
And so I'm also doing another business on the side
We really just kind of check in with people and see how they're doing with that and all that good stuff
So how much do you bring it home each year? An annual verifiable income
What's so appealing about that for you <affirmative> of
Maybe pull out a pen and notepad, take some notes, ready to learn
So just hit add it to my calendar <affirmative>. Cause it say you, it doesn't say add to calendar. Let me see.
Yeah, for sure. What made you feel excited about Airbnb in the first place?
Type of assistance I need, I would totally appreciate it.
Okay. And you mentioned 120 K, is that how much you're bringing home an income from
And so one last thing required do is fill a little form
And two put against that, you have that security of the cash that come in every single month, every single year
Yes. What was it that you asking me again?
And don't worry about the book man
I've had a pleasure talking to you
Oh, I think so, man. I think we actually have two different profiles here for you. Okay. Yeah,
I, and I'd love to just ask you if I could just ask a couple questions about your Airbnb business that that's awesome
Just working about 40 hours a week
Is that what you wanna do? Go full time with the brand?
I can't really give anybody like, oh it's gonna be long term
There's even ways to partner with owners on the property, so you might not even have to take out a lease even
And yeah, that really should be it
Will we be able to watch that before you speak with him?
So usually when people invest that much, there's typically a specific result they're looking to get to
I'd have be able to have more time with my kids
And Gotcha. And you and your husband do the Airbnb together, is that correct?
We're seeing about a two to three X return, what you pay on rent and revenue
Yeah, so I'm just looking at getting a line and having the capital to back it up. So that's why I'm doing this.
Low eight hundreds. Congratulations. You must have a ton of credit cards.
Even though that people, they bought the book
And it's two to three, is that bare minimum number or is that how many properties you wanna have to really No,
Todd? Hey, this is Cooper with B. B Formula on Brian Page's team. How you doing?
The only bad thing is I'm not, You know what? I won't have the expiration
You wanna pull up your calendar for tomorrow and just see what the day's looking like for me
So just to double confirm, before I lock it in five 30 eastern time tomorrow, you can a hundred percent make that
I'm gonna send over that video and also text you a link and I look forward to hearing how your call goes on Monday
What time zone are you in?
You too. Thank you so much.
Yeah, it works for me. Amazing.
Is gonna work. I need to get outta this dead end job. Yeah, I'm outta 10.
He's booked out, he's booked out until Thursday
Actually, right now it's only 40 and that's by design
I would go try to go to that straight away instead of trying to go in and doing all your work yourself
So just to make sure, is there anyone else involved that would be involved in your Airbnb business or is it just you?
Yeah. How do you feel like you'd wanna give back to your family if you got there?
Right? Yep. Okay. And were you able to go out and try to acquire any properties or talk to any landlords or anything like that?
So you're looking at about six 30 to about a 700 credit
Do have, but maybe a little bit here. There.
Gotcha. So you said a few seconds ago that Airbnb could help you get where you want to be.
In the ballpark is fine if
It was only for four months really
I will go on, the business might up
So they're gonna give you a call phone
I just wanna be fully transparent with you and really make sure that you could make it
Now I do have to take a look at their calendars, but how does all that sound?
And we kind of always talked about that and just never been that kind of position to ever get that far
I just have to make sure that it's not, depending on how open your calendar is, obviously for that
Well I mean again that sounds good
So I just kind of go with the flow and let things happen on its own
And so what are you bringing home each year before taxes from your nine to five
Everybody that I've ever taught based on what I do, it's not just based on experiences, it's based on what I'm doing currently
That's what we're here for right now
Well sounds like this is the right time then it's time to make this happen
So I'm gonna send over a calendar invite to your email
How do you think your family would react or feel if you just treated everyone to a trip to Switzerland?
Yeah, pull up your calendar and see what we can do.
You'll be with Don Stratton so that's his name there
Lay out a roadmap, kind of get you what you might need to get some results
Okay. Yeah, let me write this down on my calendar. Hold.
And that sounds but tell me if it sounds like a terrible idea or not
So I don't have them all to myself
4 3 4 7 6 9 7 0 9 0 2 8 0 7 5 8.
Why is generational wealth family mean? Why? Oh my gosh, sorry
So yeah, we could, I we use a app called Pay Funnels
I think one of the only unfortunate thing for me is I lost both of my parents at an early age
And it is one last important thing, Toya
This will be over the phone and they'll call you.
For sure that that's a big deal there. Tell me more about that. The debt was gonna take 20 years. What's going on?
<laugh>, just imagine for a second, let's just <affirmative> to spend real, to spend all limitations
I'm not talking to be approved for anything
What time do you finish up the workday typically?
I start work at 6 30 18, so
Your house, your car, take care of a few things that'll sort of deal,
Feel like you're living in a normal world
Well, today is fine. Day is fine.
I better be making it back. Yeah.
Love for my friends and family man. <laugh>.
I would totally embrace that and dive in head first to both feet
We're in the business of helping people and you get better results and you do better than selfishly
I'll make sure to let Mr
Well, I was gonna say I could probably do 7:00 AM tomorrow. I usually get up at four 30 or five.
It's a third party processor and so we can just take it right here
So in a perfect world, no boundaries
Awesome. Where would you go man?
I'd probably say about two. I think two would be the safest. Best.
You know, closing way you close when you start a conversation, that's when you close
And I wasn't willing to put the effort in to recreate another management structure
So are you a part of a team or anything that does Airbnb?
What it property, just trotting some things down here. Okay. And are you still physically going into your units?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh no.
Would it be too much to ask for you to watch those videos before your call?
Monday? Yes sir. Is it coming like two days from now?
I maybe do five to 10 hours a week at most on this business
Smith to start crushing with Airbnbs
But it sounds like you're committed, which I appreciate
Do you see on your Google calendar now?
That works and then we then get me that video
So some, and when you get on the call with Catherine, she's like, do this, this and this
Okay. One sec. So what's, what's the title of the email? Cause I don't think I received it yet.
Say that, how does that sound?
I don't have to do exactly what I want to do
I'm so grateful for my parents because I have so many friends that had a student loan
And just so you know, the way this works, it's super simple
Awesome. Okay, great. Sounds good. And what time zone are you in? Are you in Mountain time?
Could you tell me a little bit more about that?
Only reason I ask is because that video is super important
And right now you don't necessarily have much residual income
Mant. Absolutely. Yeah. Wish wash your peach plot there.
That's all the context that are, figure out what's best for you
Actually, no. My whole life, life I've been helping people so
I'm more, a lot of people
Looks like you got Brian's book while back on starting an Airbnb business
Is there any reason at all why you wouldn't be able to make the call?
I think that's plausible in the first year when it started
Maybe. Was it like a what do you call that? A book that you download online or something? Not a physical,
Hey, it's Thomas with B and b Formula from Brian Page's team. How you doing?
You got two seconds there to get that stuff set up and that will be your confirmation, your confirmation link in there
Awesome. So starting what time would it better for you tomorrow? Would 11:00 AM or 2:00 PM look better?
The main purpose of that whole book was to talk about the Airbnb arbitrage method
We like to travel a lot
No. I was always stuck with, okay, we got the bare minimum and that's all we can do for now. I'm like, well okay.
There's a bunch of stuff, but I just don't know how the rules work here with the short term rentals
Did you know about that? Yeah
Sure. How long is the video?
I mean I have been successful, I just want to want to, whatever I do, I just want to enhance it every year
Well I know, but you'd be surprised
And then do you wanna pull up your calendar for this coming Monday and just take a peek at what's going on?
We're actually booked up for the rest of the week
Nobody let us know beforehand something like that
Right now? So right now I am, what is it? Well, I don't know which one, but I'm 6 55. Been working on it.
I have a really big family and I really just want to be able to take care of them, get me a house
Yep, absolutely. Either one. Then you were traveling, right? Total expedit detention. I would not be driving
A little bit more about the business model, stuff like that
She has a small 401k plan that if she quit her job, it might last her a year maybe
Oh most definitely a 10 With that as far as, and like I said, I don't really just have a bad schedule, it's just the fact
But I don't think that should be an issue for you
And it looks like we did, did you confirm with Mr
Yeah. What would that mean for you being able to do that?
There's a shit ton of cool things out here in this world and I wanna go enjoy that shit
That's the mindset of a true winner right there
I may have said today, I'm sorry if I did, I misspoke
All right, talk to you later then, okay?
And so that's where I'm at right now, so,
In order to protect our executive consultant's time, especially Mr
He's gonna net $25,000 this month
Cause usually people don't invest thousand, 2000 bucks unless there's a specific result they're looking to get to
<laugh>, well hey, that's a way to put it succinctly right there.
Rensy, just make sure anyone at place on his calendar washes an important pre-call video beforehand
Now it's really quick before we can a hundred percent confirm this
I've been doing Airbnb for about three years now
And you said that you would ideally just want to build up, is building up a real estate portfolio one of your goals?
And it sounds like you want to give back on a pretty large scale
That's a boring place to be if you don't have anybody to spend it with
Okay. Can you hear me now?
Yeah, one seven. Yep. Okay. Yeah, made nothing last year.
So I'm like, okay, this be perfect
Okay. And then of that 9,000, how much of that is available?
So take the Airbnb bookings minus the rent, and that's where you profit each and every single month
Okay. Seven 50. And then what's your gross annual income, the number you'd actually be able to prove with a tax return from last year?
Let's get some skill sets there and if somebody needs help, happy to help or point 'em in the right direction
But yeah, I mean definitely I I'll How much is that book now again?
So I know their time is valuable,
Well, Carol sounds like you about to go
Man, how'd that feel getting booked out like that?
Let's get you started so you can start seeing a return on that investment
Okay. That'll be 5 0 3 New Hope Church Road.
I haven't taken the time to look through the whole book
So I was basically asking you, cuz you're at $10,000 a month, right? Right
Okay, okay. Yeah, for sure. Makes a lot of sense. And did you check out that book?
Right now it is seven o'clock. Seven
But Victor, that should be just about everything Mr
I will email it to you right after this in about two minutes.
It's like a milestone, but I think we're gonna need more than that cause that would be gross
You said you guys closed on December 27th,
Okay, so about the same this year.
<affirmative>. Gotcha. You were an athlete back in the day and since then things have just know or what? Yeah,
That would be the goal to where I, I'm, I am mean
So real life helped as well
Awesome, awesome. How can I help you, sir? Okay.
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I've had a burning question about this
Yeah, I work right now and then I have like I said, I have quite a bit of investments
But again, I don't know how much time I can make, honestly
Because if that does happen, we just charge it to the card that we have on file from when you bought the course
I mean the only thing I've done is I've stayed at Airbnbs
Absolutely man. If you could make that happen, that would be all on board for it.
Okay. Yeah, email it to me.
My goal this year, I told myself 10 Airbnbs by the end of the year, so
But because you've already invested with us and I'm like, I'm told you, my only job is to hook you up with some resources
You can cut that in half, maybe even a quarter from not.
Yeah, so the last five years have been self-employed.
But the thing is they regularly charge about a thousand dollars an hour for their Airbnb consulting
And then as far as your business goes, part of Mr
We've had so many people go through the course, over 10,000 people at this point and most people never even ended up getting started
We found they typically work just three to five hours per week and would get about one new property every 45 days
So yeah, that's definitely an option
Yeah. So fast. Do you think you can get that?
<affirmative>. Did you say Arizona? And he'll also give you a call. Yeah, yeah, Arizona.
Doing. Yes I would. What are we doing on Monday?
You go. That would be impressive. Awesome. So you got about seven 40 credit and about 70 K annual income.
Really. Where'd you guys go first?
Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be a workable thing.
Okay, let's do it say less 7:00 AM We'll get you in with Thomas
G e r imu r p h y
Actually you can build your own dream along the way, but the essence of it is you're building somebody else's dream
Man, I get up probably about five o'clock every morning
Right now I have, the majority of my money is invested in a property that I'm renovating
But a question for you, just cuz I'm a little curious here
The last thing I'm required to do is just fill out a little form here just so that Mrs
No, I'm saying if you were the smartest person in the entire world, how much would you wanna bring home each year with Airbnbs?
This is just the best way that I know to help people
It sounds like you probably have to have a pretty high level technical expertise as well combined with the sales experience
Okay. And then what's your gross annual income? Like the number you can actually verify with a tax return from last year?
I mean, well I was a caregiver way before that for 20 years
This is already my third course on different types of real estate and I haven't done anything with it
Okay, so it looks like we're getting you scheduled in and booked in with Miss Catherine Funk, which is awesome
And on average they would acquire one new rental property for rental arbitrage for Airbnb every 45 days
And Seana just kind of do some final due diligence on my end here
And then between all of your income sources, so if you have anything from military or your job, what's your annual income?
Kinda the game plan you guys come up with together
So as long as you show up to the employment, you'll be fully refunded
And so I'm actually allowed to hook you up with some resources and see if I can help you get the ball rolling
Okay. I've got a buddy that's in Costa Rica right now. Looks beautiful. Have you been?
Were you able to get any traction with Airbnb or what's going on?
So I'm super excited to see your conversation goes man
I love the short term rental industry
How much available capital do you have right now to put into deposits on the leases?
I don't think that's gonna work on the way to San Francisco
I don't know. I'd like to get started off from Airbnb, but I just have Well, what
He's literally a wizard at what he does and one of the best in the world
It really pissed me off to start with cuz it didn't happen
Well yeah, the reason that I'm reaching out is, so I'm actually a manager on the student success team here for Brian Page
But again, trying to put that forward to somebody that has a bad feeling about it, things like that you have to overcome
Awesome. Yeah, that's cool man. And you did it all basically just from the course?
And they had to shut the whole country down
Yeah, so I'm gonna email and text it over to you just so you have the link and you can use whatever's easier for you.
Okay, so looks like we got you scheduled in with Mr
Cause we do have to leave the schedule open for the paid consultations
So how many hours a week is,
I can do the seventh at 6:00 PM
All I'm saying is this is something that I feel that I possibly could do
I am currently renting looking to buy a house currently actually.
People are making, dozens of people are even making seven figures
When our bodies are young, they're fresh
Yeah. Okay, let me let check something here really quick.
It just takes a few minutes
Point you have a little bit more capital and resources to be able to jump into something like that.
Down there, just plotting along making the money.
And the reason why we have that policy in place is just obviously because we want to protect our executive consultants time
Okay, awesome. Yeah. And then when leasing proper,
Perfect. One other, is this a number I can store or does if I call, do you answer or is it one of those Google numbers?
We've had hundreds of people who we've worked closely with personally
Then okay, so you got seven 30 credit score and about 350 annual income right now
I've already sent you another copy to your email, so don't worry about that
Is your email, is that the best email for you?
I'll clarify that a little bit
Yeah, I mean covid that really through wrenching things, <laugh> when that came about and know since then. What do you do right now for work?
I mean if you want make a note, just keep the hundred
Rob Smith needs to figure out what's best for you
Sometimes you just need a little bit of help or a little bit of pointing you in the right direction
Yeah, for sure. A avenue for what?
Is this just one of those things that the decision made by both just our dynamic,
I mean, it would help me get off the boat
And 10 being like, I'm absolutely stoked for this opportunity
But they're able to save you that
Once you get that, it's like a snowball effect
All right. And you said you're working at a cafe. Are you doing that full time?
And I'm feeling that with you man
I just wanna confirm because there are only a finite amount of spots available and typically it is a $2,000 time slot
Obviously you're not just gonna stop there with one property, right? You'd wanna keep growing it if you could
And that's just really what it's about for you
And a lot of people are in that same position
No, that's okay. I'll make it work.
Don't, cause I'm strapped to a job. I don't wanna be strapped to anything.
I can basically communicate with our team about that cuz this is a pretty unique situation
So I'm curious where, I know it was a while back, but what was it that got you interested in Airbnb?
You know that way more than that
And so that's really what the call is about
I'm sorry. Hold on one. Okay you guys, thank you. You have a good day. Okay. I can talk better now. Sorry about that.
Not good. I don't know. My credit score probably around the 400 range, so
If somebody's calling to help me, then I'm like, Oh, okay
You still have taste and you're of a taste stuff
Okay, well that's all the context that are executive consultant, Mr
But when you have to put a big down payment on something, it's tough
Temps and a part of his consulting process
I'm, I'm do, I'm doing fine. This is who
I didn't like, I'm not saying that that's what this is, but that's just my life, right
You'd have to ever have to pay that
You need that salt and pepper, but the fact that you have that unselfish motivation, you wanna help as many people as you can
He obviously has a different number, but yeah, just phone call
But for those deposits on the properties, how much capital do you have available to put into those
4:00 PM Thursday that time I can make work.
So you can obviously see how it scales
I'm doing all right. How can I help?
Yeah. Is he able to get over there now?
Yeah, I might, I would probably highly consider that. <laugh>.
Say again? You just throw out a ball.
You sound like an amazing guy
Yeah, that is exactly right with our own property.
How long do you think it's gonna take for you to make enough with that? To go full time on it?
I definitely do the same thing with my appointment son.
I do, yeah, I have an iPhone. Yeah, if
Where do you guys sit in the business profile of that?
Yeah. Okay, fine. We can do that.
I mean they're killing now, it's so crazy
So I'm supposed to have a lot more than that, but I had to do what I had to do
So it's just a few questions
I don't want be working for somebody for the rest of my life, if that makes sense.
And so you should be good to go on that end
Geraldine, g e r a l d i n e. Last name is Murphy.
Sure I was beat from growing up doing it right
There? Just the goal was just to rent it out without having renters damaging my property, which I had already had that happen
And just getting those six properties, that sounds huge
Don't I didn't get that one. You only got one.
So press open and calendar or just press Yes,
Towards the end of the year.
So few hundred, few thousand dollars,
The property. More than 2000 in, less than a hundred <laugh>
Maybe there's something that I said that got you turned away
What's your commission off of it? Commission off of, what are you guys charging me in the long term off of that?
Well, usually people don't invest a thousand bucks into a course unless there's a specific result they're looking to get
Do you want me to share what have, what I could potentially do for you?
And so that's why at the end of the call, we also would evaluate whether this would be be a good fit for you
Hey, we wanna go on vacation
And then the second business I'm in is a contractor for a solar company,
And I really enjoyed talking with you
So I actually have a pretty open schedule right now
And Cause I wanna hear how you're doing and we're gonna keep in touch about this process
So let me see, of one of them has time to hop on a call
So first question, do you know what your credit score is at ballpark range?
I kind of stand in the middle with things
And I know how it can wear down on somebody.
What'd that look like? Yeah, probably traveling. Yeah, definitely travel.
What right now is restraining you from getting there?
So I'm excited we got to open up this conversation
So do you mind help me fill it out real quick? It's just a few questions here
Okay. Yeah. So I can double it.
But overall, I'm definitely, my thesis is long term hold very blush on it and the 10 year time span
Cooper, I appreciate the call. Thank you. So you're gonna email a confirmation for Zoom or what? Do you guys do a phone call?
And then it's really for us to build our family's wealth and then give it to as many people as we can right now
Is that something you'd wanna do?
Is that something you wanna do?
Man, I'm excited for you because this sounds, this could be the time man where things change
An average would be six 70 cause the one's like 6 78, ones 6 69
Cause sometimes a lot of people don't know how to do or how to do that efficiently
Some people, they're out and who knows where with a population of 5,000 people
But your vision of this is a way for you to impact the entire world
I don't know how much I'm interested in not working and not getting paid or in late evening
Obviously house on the beach, stuff like that, big surfer
I appreciate that. So we do have some time slots with 10:00 AM on Friday work for you?
If I want some just go pay cash cuz I've got a bunch of cash sitting in the bank
But if you don't try something, you don't go put yourself out there, then don't know if it'll ever go into something else
And I'll clarify this a little bit
Yeah, believe it or not mean. Mean throughout the week, the month, I mean we've always been like 95% plus really
I'll take a quick moment around before that and then go home and be prepped and ready for the call with you guys
Because it's time for a break. It's just time for a shift.
Don't have to think about. Awesome.
Well, Charise, it's been a pleasure talking with you
So with me working at the airport and stuff like that, sometimes I'll work 16 hours a day
What we're seeing them do is add about $3,000 a month in passive income within the first three months
At the moment? No, not at the moment, no
And so, All right, cool Brother <affirmative>, Andrew, have enjoyed talking to you
Yeah, yeah. Gotcha. So what do you currently do for work?
I'm curious, Sean, what got you interested in Airbnbs in the first place?
Okay, so we have central time.
Thomas Lancer is an absolute superstar
No Beal will be the one meeting with you
I mean obviously six figures and above
Hey Greg. Hey man. It's Thomas with B Formula from Brian Page's team. How you doing?
How long have you been looking for a job for?
I am Target well I work for Target <laugh>
That was when I saw that. That's why I looked into it and I went so far as to give you all the information. Yeah,
Awesome, Thank you so much. And send me those testimonials as well.
Would either this work for you?
Well I'll let the team know you're fully committed to watching that video
So basically man, they can just call you up on your cell phone
But we could avoid some of the elements of travel and float around
I understand you're saying a lot of people are having a lot of success with it
Come on now. You can't double ask me on that one. That's the one I said
But the premise of the book was essentially how to become financially independent on Airbnb without owning property
Might be a little bit outta the ordinary, but would be super helpful in me getting you the best resources that I can
Cool. How much do you need?
I appreciate you being so open with me because I think I have a super solid idea of how I can help you
I got, I got, So let me my phone's on the charger
All right, cool. I like it.
All right. Okay, that's beautiful. So yeah, make it go right for Tuesday, then we all go brother.
I've got an order I need to look at real quick for one of my subcontractors
I'd have to ask her about that
I mean I could travel more
Yeah, yeah, that's a really, really interesting little spot I would definitely check out
Yeah, so you see my little dilemma here, <laugh>.
Atlanta, okay. Yeah. So not a lot of beaches nearby. Sounds like I
You're not finding that that's happening.
I was out in DC a few years ago, so I'm a helicopter pilot so he probably Oh nice
But I don't know, I was looking to invest and make money passively, I guess Anybody else would want to do <laugh>
But those are the main two ones they look at
<affirmative>, why is that important to you to put your kids in the right school?
So you're pretty close to that
I mean obviously dude, that's, that's great
There's no generational wealth in my family
The only thing that has held me back is like, well that's gonna be $3,500 or whatever it may be for 90 days <laugh>
Yeah. So I thought you had a survey or something.
And I know everything is a risk, but I just don't know the areas or where to go or how to go
And then like I said, Mr
And how much are you cash flowing from that right now?
Doesn't know what the hell to do with himself <laugh>
But yeah, it is rough out here man
I'll have our head of customer support
We'll get that out for you
So what are you looking to make per month on the business? What's like the goal there?
Okay, gotcha. All right, well let's do Saturday. Do you, you know what's going on for you guys on Saturday? This coming 22nd?
Do you know what that's at the last time that each act?
Knowledge is the new currency and this kind of knowledge is powerful
Perfect. How do we feel? Do I feel about two 30 in the app?
They say Yeah, well my time's valuable too
Or maybe that was for you for today
Exist. I know. I'm like, why not?
I'm not saying that this is a guarantee, I'm not saying that I'll succeed
And yeah, as long as he calls at three 30 it should be definitely not an issue
And then really their goal at the end of the day is to serve as a skip button for you
Appreciate it, dude. Thanks so much.
Just changing a couple lives this morning
Oh definitely I first I'd retire the parents and then my brother and then me
Okay. Do you know what your credit score is at? You said six 70, right?
So about 2,500, that's a comfortable range
Experian, they give me a monthly report
Stratton know that you are ready to go for four 30 central time on Tuesday
Yeah, I really feel strongly this is something that could be life changing for you and your husband
Okay. Excuse that I found some time goes off in the background here,
Luckily that's not something <laugh> it's that multicolored
1:00 PM That's fine. And this is a call, right?
I'll make sure to let Mr
It was 20 16, 20 17 all the way to 2020 was just rough <affirmative>
What was the ideal income you were hoping to get? To
I don't know why I'm thinking that way, but that's what's happening
They've spent a ton of time mastering the frameworks, the strategies, everything that our most successful Airbnb students use
Awesome. And for you, for you to feel like you were successful in those properties, what would you have to see?
So I'm a manager on the student success team here for Brian Page <affirmative>
The hiring pro, that's what my team hires the full title 38 position
Totally. And are you looking at this as a way to potentially leave a job or create long term passive income? What's
So you just stopped pursuing the Airbnb business for the time being?
I understand. I understand. And I came at you hot out of nowhere in the middle of the day, so you're totally fine.
It'll just be a phone call. Yeah. Ben will call you on Monday.
Okay. Offhand, Richard, what is your credit score?
That's awesome. <affirmative>, what would you do with that type of income coming in?
Yes, a lot given the age range
A lot of people told me it's really good money
I think that that would probably work
No beaches, but we got plenty of pools.
Yeah, sorry, I get so much spam all the time, <laugh> and so I was like, Oh this is probably a spam
Okay, so your spouse would be involved with you?
I mean these guys are literally the best in the business
So that's what I, trying back, that was my Facebook name for a while
But I mean if you could do that, that'd be great
Yeah, it's nice. Start checking off your bucket list.
You know what I'm saying? So whatever they tell me is, Hey, we need you to come in then that's what I do
In a couple of months I'll have more
Our kids and know didn't have when I was coming up
Well, yeah, a lot of people that went through the book haven't actually gotten started yet, so no worries there
And then I'm just scaling, continue scaling it
Perfect. All right. And who is it coming from? What name? It's gonna be on email
What's that ideal monthly income that you'd be hoping to get to from an Airbnb business?
Especially addressing people who's just kinda of getting started and really looking to long-term generational wealth
So I haven't actually been able to put in the energy that I wanted to be at
Noah Bewa now he's our top executive consultant
Jackson has the context that he needs to help you figure out what are the kind of leases you can get
So create or 6:00 PM and I'll go ahead and confirm that time with Mr
Hey Don. This is Cooper with Bmb Formula. I'm Brian Page's team. How you doing?
And it's difficult to do all that on your own. Right. <affirmative>, it would be easier if you had someone else with you.
I am, but you know what, maybe there's something I can do. It's an hour long session you said?
And if you do wanna do 10:00 AM on Monday, then it'll be Mr
I don't know, it just depends what kind of system I had
You know what I'm saying? It's to do something that was not done for me
Why that specifically? Is that something you've been kind of thinking of doing for a while and kind of dreaming of
I've still got taste, I've still got everything. It's just I'm sicker than the dog. It's almost like a flute.
So you said I, I'll put this down the notes
That's like what going right now
It'll break down everything like I said before, so that you can have a great call
And by the way, I am. Okay. We're eastern time. I'm not sure where you guys are.
Okay. Which time are you in here? Dental,
Yes, I have meetings in the mornings typically around seven 30
Yeah, of course. You're welcome. I've been.
I guess I just didn't really follow through on it, just been really busy and I don't know
How long have you been doing that for?
Actually, can you send it to two email addresses only because sometimes Comcast throws things on my spam file that shouldn't be going there
So essentially what they're gonna do is dive in how they're gonna hop on call with you
<affirmative>? Yep, I can walk that in for you here
We'll be here for you man
I don't know, it's all different places that we want to visit
Was the name of BNB by Brian Page? You can Google Brian Page if you'd like
So I'm curious to see how it goes to man
Rens times as it is highly valuable
Do you know on just ballpark, do you know how much you're netting, how much you're pro profiting from those four properties every month?
A bunch of landlords are not allowed to even Airbnb unless they're live in the house
Now the only other thing before the call is Mr
I was just asking if there's any reason why you wouldn't be able to make that call tomorrow?
Yeah, it's obviously possible and I'm sure some have, unfortunately I haven't yet. But yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure it is possible
So in a perfect world, no boundaries
So majority of these people, they keep them in the same vicinity, same city, same town? Nope.
That's kinda like the first step, 25,000. I love that go by the way. That's a solid goal to have. Why 25,000?
One do you have? So we actually don't have access
And really it just allows us to serve you better and it's gonna save you guys both a lot of time in the call
So if you're not able to show up to the call focused or you randomly cancel, no shows like that
Cause that's just always been a hobby of yours even since you were super young, right?
However, I can get you on a one on one
So yeah, that's what I'm really looking for
That's actually in the book probably
Yeah. <laugh>, I love it man. And how about that translating into income, what would you wanna make an income from Airbnb?
Other than visiting your kids, I don't know if you'd be with them at all times
I liked the view and everything and I don't know, I just kind of was interested in it
Only reason I ask is the video is super important for you can make sure you have a great call
And so if you were the smartest person in the entire world, no limitations at all
Butler needs to figure out what's best for you
You should be. Yeah, as you should be. I totally understand that.
So it's kind of limitless for me
If we're in a position, I'm not gonna feel it
So I feel like this is something that anybody can do
So first question, this ballpark range, what's your credit score?
Yep. Long, right? I got logged in
Right. Does that make sense? Yeah,
I'm in trying to, my time is my money or my money is my time
Diane, I get you connected to her over text
You could do some big things, man
I'm active man. I'll tell you that. I'm constantly,
It's really good information will be a lot better than actually what's in the book and then I'll give you more than enough context
Well the thing is, we've had so many people purchase that course
I know that they are mission driven and they're driven and service driven
So I know that in the next year or two I can take that to a six figure income passive
I mean, how much can I just would start redistributing riches is what I would do
It's something that I have, man, I, Okay here's the deal is I've been very interested in it
Well the reason for the call is that I work with Brian and I'm a student success manager for him
I think it's in my car
That's why people love the b b formula so much
And I want to get myself outside of being the operator role and have someone doing that for me
I got a couple of cars already
Savings due to put into deposits on the leases for these properties
Yeah, actually we do have there is a model, I think we actually have it inside the course
I can cut one out and just work what they call prn
I do a lot of projects, that's why it's kind of hard to define
I started with my first one in October of 2019
Yeah, and it can be super stressful
Well listen to this, listen to this one man
Freedom means I don't have to be the nine to five job
Well, the reason I'm calling you is I'm actually the manager of our student success team here for Brian
I just started, well I just thought of it as another avenue really.
So on our team, we've got full time executive consultants who are actually a lot more equipped at getting new results than I am
Just wanted to triple check just cuz we do have a policy to charge a hundred dollars cancellation or reschedule fee for these appointments
Okay. Yeah, that's probably what I've been to do it based on all the problems I'm solving. I can't remember. And these appointments
And your main goal is to really, seven to 10 would be great, but 10 would be really great
We are growing, but as far as on our day to day residential services and stuff like that
And I just wanna make sure, 11:00 AM you and you and your partner can a hundred percent make that time?
What's the name of the book?
Those Both. Yep. Okay. What do you do right now for work?
And so it sounds like you're really just debating on whether or not you should use Airbnb for the rental
Got it. And do you go by Bart?
Yeah, that's where I just was at
And so I'm curious, how's your Airbnb journey going so far?
Cabo that's on the Cabo is on the Pacific side, right?
So Brian Page he's he, he's on a TV show called House Hacking
And <affirmative> that kind of, it's, yeah, and it's, it sucks
I got two 20 foot box trucks and they take care of everything
What state you live in right now? Now
So this is just something that you guys are doing complimentary to jumpstart me or I just want to get clear on that
So just wanna make sure that you can a hundred percent make it and then we're good to go
Well, what I need right now is I need probably another $10,000 a month coming in a residual nature
So right now, earlier you said you're kind of looking at, you're moving right now
My credit right now is 6 10, 6 10. Which bureau?
You'd have enough to put in his properties and to start getting help
And for our purposes we don't need to know a lot of that stuff
That helps you get from where you are right now to where you wanna be
Time. Cool. And then sounds like maybe you and your wife would be doing this business together or would it just be you?
Oh, it would be awesome.
Some rules, but we actually have airbnbers that are doing this business all over the United States in all of the cities
And that's something that ton of people run into
Awesome. So what's your credit score at right now?
It it's your booking just confirmed.
I mean the whole hospitality industry, what I'm saying
We'll be back home and it'll be central time.
Yeah, I wanna get you booked in here just so it's locked in and the time slot doesn't get taken out before we can finish
So it looks like we'll get you booked in with Joe's Stabler and that Wednesday at 11:00 AM Eastern time
And I mean people are into passive incomes for a bunch of different reasons really, but it is different for each person
That's what I'm trying to consolidate everything into one number
Yeah, sure. The pull the clock up. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? I
No. 1130 to 1230, Yes. Okay.
But I am running close to time in here
And then the only other thing before the call is let's see who I'm gonna put you with
Sorry, the afternoon's gonna be far better for me.
And these guys are literally the best in the business
Should I do that before I get onto the call? I was planning on trying to do so, but
Hey, it was great getting to know you and wish you the best of luck here coming up and we'll talk soon
So it's been really hard, difficult right now
All right. And which time zone are you in Central time? Eastern.
Okay, fair enough. And why 10,000 a month?
What's your I'd have to pull up their schedule and I'd have to pull up their schedule
Rogers has the context he needs, figure out what you can get approved for
And if it makes sense for your wife to be on the call too, she can be on the call too
Well, right now I'm on the tugboat in Richmond, British Columbia loading cement.
No, Nothing on how to promote the affiliate program directly.
Well I appreciate you letting me know
I guess right now it probably sounds like I'm doing too much for one person
So we do just wanna doubler beforehand that everything's good to go
All right, cool. Sounds good. I'll send you over an email and send you over a calendar invite. All right, as well.
Cause if you read the book and it's like, here's how you do it
Bare minimum that you have to live off of 10 Ks like that
Okay, so just quick question for you, for Arkansas
Good. Catherine located, she located in California?
And then what is your, Okay, that's good
Cause like I said, you don't want to give a number right now
And Audre, seriously, if whatever it is doesn't make sense for you, <affirmative>, you can always just say no.
So I'll go ahead and send over a counter
I said I'm sorry, I said that's confidential. I don't,
Is there anyone else who would be involved in your Airbnb business, like a spouse or a partner?
Awesome. What time is you in right now?
Prompting managing my own par and also helping people, like customers for their property since they're overseas and stuff
Been doing and ideally how many I understand
There's plenty of miserable wealthy people in the world. <laugh>.
I mean, yeah, I would definitely be open to talking to somebody, especially if it's free at first. So <laugh>.
They make you feel when you're driving
He does. He spends his time between Texas and Oregon.
We went through some of the training courses but never really did get our foot off the ground <affirmative>
Yep, two days from now. March 21st.
Okay. Tomorrow You got it. Sounds good. Uga. Well, I'll talk to you tomorrow, but I
All right. Looks like wayne boards hotmail.com or@outlook.com. Sorry, Wayne. Wayne boards outlook.com is your primary.
I can't watch it tomorrow night. Tomorrow morning or something. No, I can't do tomorrow morning. Yeah, I'll go watch. I'll watch it beforehand. Yeah.
And then another thing that typically look at is like W twos
It just takes about 20 to 30 minutes
Gotcha. Ago. It was a while ago, right? Yeah,
Let me think for a second.
So Jovan, I'm super excited to see how your call goes with him
So just so that we're fully aware, would there be anyone else involved in your Airbnb business? Like a spouse or a partner?
I could streamline everything that I'm doing and spend more time with the family
It's not gonna cost any money, right? It's like a free call.
I don't know where you guys are located but I'm in Alabama, I'm in Birmingham, Alabama
A lot of people haven't been able to get started yet and you're kind of newer to the whole Airbnb business
We have a great time there
And then just be crystal clear don't have to set it up for it
But it's still hard cuz there's not somebody holding your hand telling you to do this and do that
So next Monday or Tuesday? Well, looking at Monday, I got four things with Tuesday
But if I get the money, y'all help me figure out how to get the next renter and all that stuff.
My current annual income it's gone up a lot since I started working
So one, it's in one we retire, we have something to fall back on I guess, if you will
No, I'll be fine. I mean, my kids might be in the background making noise a little bit unfortunately, but that's probably be the only thing.
<laugh> <laugh>, that would've been too bad, right? $50,000 a month would've been too bad
You stayed clean, you did this and I always see you
<affirmative>. And are your properties fully <inaudible>? Hundred percent occupancy?
Did your parents put you on their credit cards? Did you have a credit card from your parents and your own name?
So I wanted to make sure you can make it which sounds like it shouldn't be a big deal for you since you can
com and if I meet someone that really clicks <laugh> my living conditions are not ideal
Right brother. Talk to you later.
She wants to go to Paris.
No, you don't need to worry about providing any value, they're just gonna kinda help over some things with you
My current annual income is 186,000
You said that's about, that's over 5,000 or what was that?
I already have some lender friends that I could get loans from
It. Yeah. And then do you have any credit cards right now?
Okay, no worries. Could just be a ballpark figure as well.
I had some losses in my family as well in 2020
We can do it over the phone
Grow, maybe give them education or tools or something that they can then use to make their own money.
And the reason that we have that in place is obviously we want to protect our executive consultants' time
I love South Florida, I love Key West <affirmative>, but I don't spent much time, I haven't spent much time there
Call me back probably a bunch of times
Good. That did it get on your calendar?
I mean, based on what you're saying
The landlords at the end of the day, they're just looking for rent
It allows us to serve you better and it both saves us a lot of time
And really the senior consultants have the information on that
Sorry, what was the time? I had a text message coming in on you.
I normally don't answer calls that I do not know because that's just the way it is these days
You got, well what time zone are you in? Cause I think, I'm not sure if it's central or I don't be knowing out
Perfect. Awesome. So you guys don't foresee any reason why you shouldn't be able to make that right on Friday five 30?
Okay. And central time is your time zone?
You like him about it and I've sold him a little book. Had he? He's got one in Vegas right now.
I can get you on the phone tomorrow,
I'm curious for you man was something in particular that got you excited about Airbnb?
Yeah, how would that change things with your family?
You know what I'm saying? Who's gonna fly? Who's gonna fly? Yeah
So looks like he has a 1:00 PM Pacific actually open today
Could you go ahead and step that really quick
And then that was at the pandemic hit just like everyone else
It's there, but the customer service and behind what we do and stuff like that, it is neat
And even having free time sometimes a couple of days is a little bit too much
There. Yeah, what time is it? So you said you're gonna be in Kentucky tomorrow, right?
Would you wanna hop on as soon as this evening? I actually just had a seven o'clock open up for tonight as well
Then yeah, so I'll send those over to you and then I'll also message Diane or after this call as well
How do you think that would would change if family gatherings were that much more extravagant or able to happen? <affirmative>?
I don't want it to get taken cause I know you were looking at that one 30 spot tomorrow
This is honestly probably one of the best ways to do it
<affirmative>. So actually finding property owners who at lease the properties to you.
So for that 5:00 PM Eastern time, is that a time that your wife can make as well?
I would definitely try for sure for him. Where'd you go? Not sure. Anywhere. <laugh>
And then I needed my partner, my husband's help, but I cannot do but myself only
Do you mind helping me fill out really quick just a few questions?
And so <laugh>, I mean its, it's kind of a selfish reason
So in a perfect world, no boundaries
And these guys are literally the best in the business what they do
Yeah, so honestly someone on our team who would be better to talk to you about all of that is one of our executive consultants
So it looks like you got confirmed with Mr
This? Hey Jonathan, this is Cooper. I'm with b and B Formula on Brian Page's team. How's everything today?
So actually just one last thing here
So that's one other reason that I wanna just get out this hard label work so I can take care of myself way better
So let's put the, Yeah, for my realtor aspect, I averaged around 25,000 each
And then CBC is 6, 3, 5,
Is the Steven VG or steven
Yeah, I always love to ask that cuz I'm a big traveler myself
No problem. Doing it right now. Let's see calendar invite, confirm.
Right now I'm at a nine.
And that takes money to be able to do that, to go to all these different places and visit all these historical religious sites
I don't know why I'm, this number popped in my head, but whatever. If I made $10,000 a month, I would be happy.
I am so sorry I transferred over to them, but No, it's okay
I started my llc, which I currently have
You know what I mean? So that's kind of part of it
Is Monday completely shot? Cause I've got a few things open there
I actually went to high school in Florida. I just moved out here a few weeks ago.
And it doesn't take a year or I'm just saying a year
<affirmative>, I've been phone calls like these before and they upsell you for products and services and things like that
Butler needs to figure out what's best for you
About 12, okay. So what's your plan from now going forward to get from 12 to 20,000 a month?
I used all the points to travel.
Would you feel more comfortable for maybe three or 400 or 500,000? Would that be more of a comfortable number at that point? Okay
Yeah that might be good. Yeah, that be would be nice.
Could you help me fill out some of that information for them? It's just a few questions
Eating my food in the fridge, <affirmative> before I go to another restaurant
And then also save you some time when you hop on the consultant
And then what ended up happening is we bought a poultry facility a chicken farm, and we raised broiler chickens
Be like, let's just go here tomorrow
Okay. So do they have a calendar link that you're gonna send me?
You really wanna get your first year Airbnb
I think we probably covered more on this phone call than the information given in the book
5:00 PM I thought it was 5 45.
Well sometimes I go out there and I try to visit once a month or once every five, six weeks.
That's just a policy that we have in place
<affirmative> you thinking creative, giving people situations, so he's really gonna be able to help you out
Yeah, right now we've actually been able to help hundreds of people create multiple six figure incomes
Well, I mean I am the type tool to keep my mind going
Google, they, they definitely got something.
The attraction is that's close to the Colorado River and close to a golf course
No. Pretty much that depleted, pay my mortgage on this house where this free rental stays there.
Sounds wonderful man, I, I'm excited for Thanksgiving too, honestly
You can gimme a ring if you need anything
Would you like to do one of those time slots?
Squeaky clean of the valley gmail.com. Cool.
Can you hold for a second? This is something I gotta take
And on average, and quite frankly, it's really on the low end, they would be profiting from that one property about $1,500 a month
You're not seeing a ton of extra cash flow coming in
Six 20 credit? Yeah. Okay. And what's your gross annual income? The number you can verify with a tax return from last year?
I didn't write the book itself
Can I help you? Good, good, good.
Yeah, we're out here in Phoenix as well
I'm not sure what he has available tomorrow
